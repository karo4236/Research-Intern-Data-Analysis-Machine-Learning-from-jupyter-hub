{"user_id": "719291", "text": "i get magma is molten rock in the earth and lava has erupted simply put but why are they different at all? as the title says, i had to fire a handgun in self defense for the first time earlier this week. first off, real quick; everything's okay and i'm unharmed. i had a run-in with a very unhappy bull moose on a rather narrow and steep trail. i didn't see him, bedded down right on the trail, until i was too close and that's when i stopped. at first he seemed mellow, but he was looking from side to side for a second or two. suddenly he jumped to all fours and lurches towards me. i started backing away, going down the trail while trying to keep an eye on him. i thought he was gonna stop after a couple of feet of us both moving as i recall gaining a little distance but i pulled the shirt from over my pistol. no sooner did i do so that he starts running down the hill trail straight towards me. i have a hard time remembering everything clearly damn stress! but i dropped my carbon fiber pole on the ground and drew the gun. i managed to establish both a two handed grip and sight picture, both very poor i'm sorry to say but i pushed it out it front of me and as soon as the gun's in my line of sight i pressed the trigger. now, i'm below the animal and i believe the round struck the trail, right in front and to left of his front hoof from the dust kicked up i remember. now my grip was shit as i said and the slide skinned a bit off the top of my left thumb. the moose, maybe eight yards away if i'm lucky, skids to halt like a damn loony-toons character; i swear to god you could hear the rubber tire screeches, lol. anyway he then turns to his left with his head off into the bushes and i keep trotting down the trail. i don't know what else i could have or should have done; i don't believe i had any other choice. but i made it out of the canyon without any hoof-prints on my rib cage or skull and i don't believe i hit the animal. i returned to the scene with a wildlife officer and we found no trace, no blood but i got my pole back and we found the brass. edit; thank you to everyone for all the great feedback! to address some comments i'll follow up with a few clarifications. first, i only fired one round. again he was close but he stopped quite fast after the first shot and then he turn to his left as i stated. i didn't think anymore were necessary, and i turned and hustled down the trail. i had the presence of mind to know i didn't want to harm the animal unless absolutely necessary. why'd i miss? honestly, aside from poor form under stress i'm not sure. really, i'm still sorting out everything that was going through my head a the time. of course i absolutely had the intention of shooting but it was a surprise trigger break. it's possible i fired a split second too early or jerked the trigger and don't forget my sight picture was garbage. i'll be the first person to tell you that warning shots are useless, unneccesarliy risky, especially in an urban setting and generally i don't believe they're justified under general laws of self defense un the us, thought every state will vary. my 2008 honda accord ex? 4 cylinder is making a grinding or rattling when it starts. i know i should have it looked at but i wanted to know, how much is reasonable when having the starter repaired or replaced parts and labor? it might seem like a good idea. but is it illegal just like planting animals or fish? edit i understand the ecological dangers that this could pose, just like illegally planting fish in a stream. nor do i ever wish to do this. again, i was just curious about the law. i have one for the range but i don't know if i'd carry them in the field. are they as reliable as their 5.56 counterparts? edit thanks for everyone's input! i saw the nuclear reactor gif earlier and i've e heard of and seen cr on the internet before. what is it and why does it happen? ps. sorry if this is a reposted question, i couldn't find a previous discussion on the topic. forgive me i could not find an straight answer in the faq. that may be my fault. anyway i know i can legally build an ar pistol from a virgin lower receiver. but what counts as virgin ? i take this to mean i can't bu a rifle and strip down the lower and make it a pistol or can i ? is that just plain not allowed or would i just need to get a tax stamp first ? what about a stripped lower that i purchased, assembled with a butt stock to a completed lower, then wish to dis-assemble? if i need a tax stamp first that's okay as it would be cheaper then buying a whole new virgin lower. this afternoon i came across something awful up bc canyon. after a hike i arrived at the top of guardsman s pass and found several people trying to console a young man. apparently a relative of his had committed suicide nearby just shortly before i arrived, literally minutes before i pulled up. 911 was called and both unified fire, unified police and park city police arrived shortly after but nothing could be done. more than anything i just want to know if the kid is okay and with family or friends right now. not asking for details or names. believe me i know more than i want to. hey i was just wondering if someone can tell what the current turnaround for the batf is? thinking i might wanna do an sbr. your ut dl explicitly states any change of address must be noted with the dld. does bci have the same change of address notification requirement? i ve purchased two pistols since moving and the ffl was only concerned with the address change on the dl."}
{"user_id": "540368", "text": "i'd like to see bonuses given for consecutive games played. as it stands you have to leave the game after every round because of leavers if you want to get a full game. i don't want to punish people, when you gotta go you gotta go, but there's literally no reason to keep playing if you lose a round because your teammates are going to bail. i run with chiz and orlandeau. i can usually hit a few chains, up to around 8 or so, but i read about people getting 26 chains and stuff like that and i never seem to hit them. is there some vital piece of information i am missing? ill use dr first, then after like a half a second send in chiz, but if there is an easy way to position them and use auto, id love to hear it. i also dont think i have a strong finisher. no luneth, i have a giglamesh, but hes still low level. usually i use friend units. thanks! i am wondering if there are ever events in which your old 4 star units be useful? for example, i am sitting on a vivi that i just cant bring myself to get rid of because i loved ff9, but if a ff9 event rolled around in the future, it would be pretty sweet. it happens more and more frequently where i kill someone with a heavy or unblockable attack and my character sits there with the execution choice and i'm mashing circle because i don't want the other guy to kill me but it doesn't cancel fast enough and he wrecks my back. the best way to level a new character is in for man modes. playing a new character in a four-man is a great way to get mashed by someone wearing 108 gear. it's a vicious cycle. you're basically running around trying to rob your teammates of killing blows. this needs to be changed to include assists because as it stands, you're better off trying to get your mates killed so you can ensure you get the finishing blow. when the samurai win every faction war, what's the incentive to stay on the losing side and not jump ship? as it stands now personal pride is the only thing keeping me from doing it because i will more than make up for the lost rewards this battle with the winning rewards moving forward if i do switch. if i move the entire nox folder to a usb flash drive, will i be able to just plug in a different pc and use ffbe, or does it all get stored in different folders and stuff? sorry for the dumb question, i dont know much about computers. i just finished a game where i had eight takedowns and the three bites on my team all had zero. needless to say it was a pretty bad beating considering i was playing against three players in a dominion game. if level to bots are going zero kills and nine deaths than they need to be bumped up in difficulty. 'm wondering if there is any major incentive to pull on non-mog king banners. generally you can get through these elite events with your basic units and they don't seem to really provide anything else other than generally just being good new units, as opposed to king event units where you get a good new unit and a bonus to your materials. unless you're a collector it seems better to me just to skip these banners."}

{"user_id": "789103", "text": "say i have an illness. drug a has a 50 chance of curing the illness while drug b has a 10 chance of curing the illness. if i take both drugs at the same time assuming you can get benefits from taking both what's the overall chance i'll be cured? edit sorry for the confusion. let's assume the drugs do not interact with each other and have no effect on each other's efficacy. i know buzzcuts are pretty hard to pull off unless you're david beckham, but i'm just so tired of having long hair. just gets messy very easily and constant need of styling it. so yeah any thoughts? btw i have a tall, narrow forehead. hairline is alright but slight recession on the sides still thick head of hair somehow . i feel like buzzcuts are easier to pull off for narrow foreheads as opposed to a crewcut. i'm only interested in fillers atm so no implants. would a longer ramus and lower gonial angle give me a more balanced jaw especially from the front? front pic also sorry about earphones - don't think it's too much of an issue. was thinking of getting some but always hear they do worse than their competitors in the same price range. how much are beats actually worth - what in-ear alternatives where the quality is almost as good? long story short i hate my face and body because of my body dysmorphic disorder. my face exists with me in the present moment so living in the present moment doesn't help does it? most people say going to the gym can make you feel confident which i don't doubt. but for me, the gym has waaay too many mirrors. i am constantly reminded about how bad i look. also, i'm usually one of the skinniest guys there so i don't have to worry about falling short of people to compare myself to. fml. i eventually really do want a surgical rhinoplasty but it isn't possible any time soon myraid of reasons . i can get filler every six months which still hugely improves the appearance of the nose. i only plan on using dissolvable filler but i'm still not sure if it would mean i would get a less aesthetic rhinoplasty result after all these filler injections. i've read conflicting views on realself. 1. stop grooming doing any compulsive activity relating to your appearance. 2. practice present moment focus - or meditation. 3. when you have thoughts about your appearance, make a mental note about them and make a note about how you feel. helps to keep you separate from your thoughts. 4. this involved a lot of discussion but basically we put too much emphasis on appearance - it's not that important. try to critique why you value appearance. i've got bdd but i also get anxious about whether people think i'm boring or a loner or just one of them unlikable people that you just steer clear from. i've tried imagining myself getting ps. honestly i'll probably still have the same friends, same job, same life, same feelings. i won't suddenly get new friends because i've changed my face a little. i do still want it because i dislike my features but somehow also recognise i'll probably forget i had them done and go back to feeling how i was before."}
