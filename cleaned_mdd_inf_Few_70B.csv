- yeah it's something that needs to be deeply thought into. something remnant like or kill activated could also work even if it's straight up weird kill clip. at the end of the day the idea itself is great keep going!

- indeed, the tbag reboot of tb2 is what i thought of when i saw the new dragon ship.

- that makes sense! and explains why i only see it sometimes when i set a second alarm on days when it s really important i wake up then. i m seeing it brighten for the second alarm. thanks!

- that s so outrageous when you actually say it like that lol. for profit home owners insurance in fl makes no sense. just none. it s going to be like that in the mid west soon with how powerful those hail storms and tornadoes are becoming as well. just make a very basic federally subsidized homeowners insurance plan like the fema flood insurance plan and put a cap on it. that would solve like 70 percent of the states issues and it would leave the coas and south fl hjomes dealing with private insurance or state ran insurance. at this point i can t blame for profit insurance for the rate hikes because this state is disaster prone. miami was flooded from a basic thunder storm this year lol. just imagine if a cat 3 hits it.

- i can't find a scan for the uk version, but maybe you want an official alternative cover.

- you re too kind but don t be nervous! it takes me a lot of courage to socialize with people as well.

- maybe there's a makerspace or a club in your area . doing that by hand is insane unless you got arms like kingkong.

- the term golden age referances so much more then who is stronger. it would be an age of sorcerers who control the people, while normal people make up a small percent of the population. an age of jujutsu innovation, de, hwb, da. sukuna was surprised that jogo didn't know what his ct was but on second thought remembered in his time there where very few cursed spirits as the bulk of people didn't contribute to there creation. to ask if it was an era of stronger people the short answer is yes on average just because the ratio of sorcerer to non was so vastly different. the long answer becomes alot more complicated as we only get to see who kenny picked and not the strong who have already fallen or rejected the offer of reincarnation or if you will dominating another's soul most in a good alignment would of likely attempted to kill kenny.

- but macro for patiece is not cheat, so maybe all whites u say using just macro and its cheating for u or no?

- this is clearly staged but the problem is real still some of these strollers or what you call em are impossible to fold i know i been working in pre-school for 14years and i still struggle every time we get a new one. the all fold differently.

- from my personal experience everyone s may vary based on many factors, like full scope, examiner, ect i had an instance where a girl was heavily drunk, but we had messed around prior to that and after that as well several years to be more accurate .the examiner was totally fine with it. it s moreso things like taking advantage of someone and knowing they probably wouldn t engage otherwise. you will talk about a lot before you are tested to cover those grey areas you may have.

- not surprised, they are brainwashed to believe all the bad that has happened to them is caused by jews. the truth is very different.

- make sure to have someone film the whole thing for you. it s a way to actually remember the experience plus you ll learn a ton from seeing your mistakes third person. then you get to make fun new ones next time.

- i'm running this next session and couldn't find a map with the real entrance removed, so i went ahead and made my own. i also removed the gas chamber behind the false entrance as well.

- i see. if ure saying multiplayer is somewhat mw 2019, then i guess multiplayer is good. for zombies, im guessing they dont have much content compared to cold war, but i'm still giving it a chance since it was released late last year. and considering the new mw 2 wont have zombies, im having high hopes they will release as much, or more, content as compared to cold war.

- they get to decide what it means now ? they have their own ideas about it, yes, but the audience cannot decide what a work of art means. let's say you write a satirical play on certain political events. how can an audience decide that this is no longer what the play means?

- just about any of the imps. caladog always gives me trouble, and godun. godun is one that feels particularly personal. i had just taken a balgard by the skin of my teeth, left with maybe about 50 men out of my party of like 200, and up strolls godun and about 6 merc parties there to rain on my parade. i convinced him to abandon ragnavad and join me and the vlandians with a hefty bribe and about a dozen noble horse i was a noob back then and didnt realize theye were slowing me down. well, along comes a vote on who to give balgard to and would you believe good old derthert against the advisement of the council passed me over as the fief in favor of his new sturgian pet godun! i was in awe. the next 5 castles i took from sturgia all went right to godun. i retracted my oath to derthert and went rogue for a while. and one day ol derthert died. would you guess who became the next king of vlandia? thats right. none other than godun. i deleted that save.

I've recently been noticing that I've got an awful lot of trouble with my own life's rhythm, and it seems like there's something seriously amiss. It appears to be a struggle in which I'm unable to thrive, and every time I think I've found the answer, something else crops up and I'm back at square one. Sometimes I'll just zone out for a bit and then get back into the swing of things, but other times it's like I'm completely frozen in place. It would be great if I could somehow manage to figure this out because my life is getting pretty stagnant at this point.

- take five is maybe the most famous example, being actually written in 5 4 of course.

- wore my hanshin jersey the morning after they clinched the central league last year. rush hour in sannomiya kobe. took some pics with the digital signage at hanshin station celebrating the championship. got some strange looks from folks though . more than i do on most days even.

 [/INST]","Here's a normal Reddit comment:

I've been thinking lately about how people have this tendency to romanticize their past, no matter how good or bad it was. We're all guilty of doing so, and I think it's because we subconsciously want to make ourselves sound better than what we truly are today. It's like our minds are trying to rewire the way we think about our past experiences to make us feel more dignified in some way.

In my opinion, this is why people often start their stories off with ""I used to be..."", then proceed to talk about how they've changed or grown over time. This isn't unique to Reddit, though; it's a common pattern you'll find in people from all walks of life. It's human nature to want to make ourselves sound more interesting than we actually are.

We should be aware of this tendency and try to avoid falling into the same pit. The fact that we're even aware of our own limitations is what",200,0.8,0.95,40,1.1,0,0,['</s>'],Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct.IQ1_S.gguf

- ftx is not at risk. they're different companies and don't share any assets between them, they both have different objectives.

- op asked for something on the cheaper side. while this is a phenomenal pedal, i think 350 is probably outside of op's budget.

- the fact that bc is only up 1 score after everything that happened this half is not a good sign for the peoples team tbh.

- this is more of a proof of concept card, and i plan to add some restrictions to it in the future, including the summoned monster not being able to attack that turn and only being able to be done once per turn.

- get him a ninebot g30, he can learn to hack it to make it go from 25kmh to 33kmh stock. it feels pretty good as a kid making your scooter go faster the g30 has huge huge huuuggeee market of parts, you could make a g30 into a beast thst out performs a lot of other scooters. reason i m saying this is because he can grow up to like 14, learn stuff about electronics, put a more powerful battery motor on it, put suspension on it, and learn heaps of stuff. the g30 is quite a loved scooter, for its stock form but especially its aftermarket potential.

- 24 - usa - about 800 self employed. i just quit an ok job that paid 1900 per month after taxes, but it was killing me emotionally and mentally. i just couldn't do it anymore.

- ikr, they made a whole video on their child being sick and literally filming him vomitting.

- ninja 400 if you like sporty look. rebel 500 cruiser look. cb500x adv look all have abs models and are usually pretty easy to find used. expect to pay about 750-1000 less than new for a good copy that's a few years old.

- you have enough money for this trust me it is so much more quiet then intels stock cooler and does a better job for the temp. it fits your socket.it fits your case. its thin enough that it doesnt get in the way of your 4th ram slot. it comes with one fan and only requires one fan. however i need symmetry in my life so i bought a 2nd and hooked it up to a splitter for the cpu fan header to have 2 fans. this thing is great for its price.

- did you live in a cave all your life? you're claiming that master is an equivalent of miss ma'am madam whereas i've never heard anyone calling someone master in public. anyone who didn't live in a cave knows sir is the male equivalent of miss ma'am madam, and miss ma'am madam have implications about perceived age whereas sir does not. i was saying that's sexist but reddit deleted it just because i was honest and they can't accept the fact that maybe their language is sexist.

- yeah, but most people can at least understand the concept of affection, and i'm sure op conveyed that he cared for his her mom.

- is it just me, or does that sign definitely say beastway ?

- ftx is not at risk. they're different companies and don't share any assets between them, they both have different objectives.

- was it the blu-ray combo pack from 2018 or the single blu-ray from 2007 that you found at goodwill?

- all she really has to do is keep it policy related and he llook like a fool. ask him how he s going to address the border in great detail. he wont be able to do it. ask him how he s going to help americans with his tax plans in detail. he won t be able to do it. if she stays away from the insult matches and dick measuring contests then she should beat him handily.

- definitely gremory vs. bael in the sitri game the object severely neutered the entire gremory team as a whole which was cool learning experience for rias but other than that really lame tbh cause sona had such a big advantage at that point. it was still a great match especially to see how smart sona was and how her peerage responds to that. my 2 favorite rating games are from much farther in the series so spoiler alert !the much better match vs sona was sona vs issei it showed how the best girl of the series, ravel, was as good if not better than sona at tactics. on top of that the 1 v 1 vs saji was soooo gooood. the emotion was off the charts.the other really great rating game was issei vs rias. there were just so many emotions with grayfia, xenovia, and issei everyone was almost facing their rivals in that match it was also the first time where issei truly felt like an equal to rias and fully worthy to be able to marry her. absolutely loved this rating game.

- i do have cta, but i should get the lifetap wand for mephisto. i also have a beast of an exile ebugged eth sacred targe with 43 res , but i didn't know if that was worth getting rid of the extra res from hoz.

I'm perpetually stuck in this limbo where every day feels like a battle against the monotony of life. It's like being lost in a sea of gray, where nothing seems to have any significance or purpose. I've become this perpetual wanderer, constantly searching for meaning but never finding it. That's why I'm drawn to this subreddit - hoping to find others who understand my plight. It's not about the diagnosis; it's about how we respond and adapt to our circumstances that really matters.

- at the end of the game, if you choose a path that leads to the matrix, they say that v's body is too much johnny for v to live. you can choose to either let johnny keep the body and live a long life or keep your body and die shortly because it will see you as a foreign body. i have 2 problems with this. 1 if i keep my body and die wouldn't the chip that is turning your brain into johnny just keep doing its thing. it seems that as it follows its programming it would repair your body by removing the remaining v parts and continuing to create another construct of johnny. meaning either way he lives on in your body? and the one that really bothers me. 2 why can't you load the v construct on the chip that is in your brain? it obviously functions well enough and you always have someone standing right there who could slot the chip into mokishi download your construct onto it and jam it back in your head. wouldn't this cause the chip to turn your brain back into a v construct allowing v to live as long as johnny would?

- remember to vote for jon ossoff and raphael warnock, if you want -marijuana to be decriminalized and or legalized at the federal level - 15 federal minimum wage -climate change to be taken seriously -increased access to healthcare and coverage for predicting conditions -racial and criminal justice reform -mitch mcconnell to not be the senate leader anymore did i mentioned marijuana decriminalized and or legalized at the federal level? there s a bill that the house just passed earlier this month that s just sitting on mitch mcconnell s desk that, if the senate voted on and passed, would decriminalize marijuana on the national scale, which would open the doors for georgia to legally sell it recreationally and put those tax revenue dollars to good use in our state. if ossoff and warnock are both voted in, you have a 50 50 split in the senate, which means republicans and thus mitch mcconnell wouldn t be in control of the senate and what bills are voted on. mitch is not going to vote on this major, historical legislation, but with a 50 50 split, the vp soon to be kamala harris , would be the floor leader and the tie-breaking vote, if necessary. if you enjoy marijuana, or at least believe in other peoples rights to enjoy it casually just like alcohol, and or any of the other above listed important issues, please please please vote for jon ossoff and raphael warnock in this senate runoff election!

- i had never played smash before ultimate was released. it took me a full year to get pikachu into elite and now i pretty much just stay there. since then i've gotten like 10 more characters into elite. i'm still not really good because while i like competitive matches, i don't really practice much and pretty much never practice fundamentals. but i feel like i read most other online players pretty well and punish their habits. i feel like if you can do that, it can take you a long way online. most players are predictable in some way.including yourself if you play on autopilot.

- they get to decide what it means now ? they have their own ideas about it, yes, but the audience cannot decide what a work of art means. let's say you write a satirical play on certain political events. how can an audience decide that this is no longer what the play means?

- even weirder then how you care so much about american politics, ever think about getting a hobby?

- coming in 2nd place a lot isn't exactly bad luck. i agree with you though, a gibbons win would be nice to see. he is near the top of the american crit cup points. there are a few p 1 racers that are pretty accessible through strava instagram youtube etc and he's one of them. makes me feel like i knew the band before they were cool .

- sounds like nick. he never finished at u of w from what i remember hearing. must have been too busy eating and harassing women. ever see that story of him and a woman who was not his wife breaking into a closed kelseys at 2am.lol. he's a gem forsure!

- on the fb page, i just can't attend the weeklies because i work monday evenings.

- and you also were included in christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. when you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised holy spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are god s possession to the praise of his glory. ephesians 1 13 - 14 niv.

- i have a non seasonal druid, which i'm running trample poisonslide on. i'm seeing the s1 trample poisonslide is way way better due to the heart. would love to play that, but i don't want to make another druid. is making another druid my only way to get access to the new build? or are there other smart things to do? some background dad of 2 and don't have loads of time to play. i am just lvl 67 and played since launch. don't want to need to start over as well.

- i definitely resonate more on the right, but i ve lived in california my whole life. everything that i know is here, and i felt like i wanted to help protect the people that i love here. i guess that s my main conflict working to serve the people that i know here in california or going to a place that would be more hospitable in terms of making enough to afford the cost of living.

- does anyone know the name of these shoes? i cannot find the actual name for these and it s driving me crazy.

- that s exactly what i did a few months ago-moving the eip to a different line. still waiting for the one year anniversary march 2024.

- yeah, just like europa is europe in swedish, tagalog, romanian, polish, norwegian, dutch, lithuanian, italian, croatian, basque, spanish, danish and a whole bunch of other languages that decided to copy the latin term verbatim. wow, look at all those nazi languages! yes, they're nazis, but saying they're nazis because they use the word europa is a really dumb argument.

- 2 beast-warrior monsters, including 1 ancient warrior monster cannot be special summoned, except by link summon. if this card is link summoned, you can set 1 ancient warrior spell trap directly from your deck. ancient warrior monsters this card points to cannot be destroyed by battle or card effects. if an ancient warrior monster you control destroys an opponent's monster by battle; you can target 1 card your opponent controls; destroy it. you can only use each effect of ancient warriors path - indomitable chen ziying once per turn.

- prior to declaring war to my first neighbor, it seemed that one of their colonized systems defected leading to a new empire popping in and going to war with the main empire. after completing the domination tree, i had made sure to build up my two fleets to their maximum size, at the time, of 40 ships before going to war. i had also made it to where the only claimed systems were ones that were colonized. upon going to war i made short work of both empires. it was practically a cakewalk given that my two fleets each were at 3k fleet power, more than enough to completely demolish any opposition. upon conquering the two empires, i decided to use their pops to generate large sums of food for a short period of time. i had to make sure that none of my pops were growing at any of the planets while the natives were being processed. so far, i'm very pleased with how this empire turned out, especially given how quickly i've gotten my production at in such a short amount of time. not only that, but i'm also thankful that it hasn't been broken too much after the patch came in.

- i mean it depends a lot on what stage of the game you are talking about. mid to late game assuming ur going ap your daggers and r do pretty much everything. try to set up daggers and go in when the enemy team blows important abilities. learning my damage in lane was much harder for me. if you want to do damage in lane u want to start and item with ad so ur adaptive rune shards get converted into ad. you also need to use pretty much every part of your kit well to win trades, which includes weaving autos in between spells. this was the hardest thing to learn imo and is something i still struggle with.

- i will be back to check up after the reveal next tuesday.

- work more fiber into your diet. chia seeds, oatmeal and tons of popcorn does it for me so when you go, it all goes ; coffee helps you go to the bathroom, but the lack of fiber is most likely why your stools aren t solid. cut back on oils to and drink tons of water .this is coming from someone with a classic case of jewish inherited ibs - have been to several doctors including gastroenterologists and refuse to take a medicine to cure what should be happening in all of our bodies naturally short of those with ibd s it s 100 diet related you don t need to introduce additional chemicals into your body, yes they work, but i prefer solving the issue rather than just throwing something at it to temporarily suppress it.

- if products don't help, maybe it's got something to do with your diet. avoid eating oily foods, avoid drinking high fat milk, meats, too much sugar or egg yolks. try cucumber and salads with high water content. try this eating routine for a few weeks, and if it doesn't help, try a dermatologist.

- suzanne collins was born in the us so why are you assuming she would use terms in the same way british culture would vs the way americans would her book?

- prior to declaring war to my first neighbor, it seemed that one of their colonized systems defected leading to a new empire popping in and going to war with the main empire. after completing the domination tree, i had made sure to build up my two fleets to their maximum size, at the time, of 40 ships before going to war. i had also made it to where the only claimed systems were ones that were colonized. upon going to war i made short work of both empires. it was practically a cakewalk given that my two fleets each were at 3k fleet power, more than enough to completely demolish any opposition. upon conquering the two empires, i decided to use their pops to generate large sums of food for a short period of time. i had to make sure that none of my pops were growing at any of the planets while the natives were being processed. so far, i'm very pleased with how this empire turned out, especially given how quickly i've gotten my production at in such a short amount of time. not only that, but i'm also thankful that it hasn't been broken too much after the patch came in.

- i took a lot of pictures while playing across different saves and i'd like to find out where they are kept. i can't find anything about where to i can find them so i'm asking here.

- here s the thing that i should have mentioned said roommate and my girlfriend do not talk to each other, he doesn t greet me so i don t greet him. she and i really both dislike him for good reason and he knows this. so to ask this as soon as she walks upstairs is both uncommon and something that would almost definitely make my girlfriend uncomfortable.

- ikr, they made a whole video on their child being sick and literally filming him vomitting.

- i m just messing with you dude, calm down. rodney alcala 170, ted kaczynski 167 was a math prodigy and accepted to harvard at 16, ed kemper tested 160 then retested at 145, lawrence bittaker also took the test twice and scored lower the second time at 145. the warden of the prison heard bittaker was gifted, made him take the test for people applying to work at the prison and bittaker scored higher than anyone who d taken said test, including the warden. then there s charlene gallego a child violin prodigy who was said to be 160. i ve read books on kemper, kaczynski and bittaker. fascinating look into psychology.

- yeah honestly people at that age need a lot of emotional support regardless, nevermind when they've only been alive for a year and are tasked with basically saving the world. addam i'm sure was a great father to his own kid, but an ai demigod does not a good practice child make. xc2 in general does a good job of making the behavior of its characters believably reflect their age or rather the maturity you'd associate with that age, since blades are ageless . while rex and nia definitely mature the most, from beginning to end rex and nia behave as impulsively in both good and bad ways as you'd expect from a couple of 15 year olds, p m definitely exist within the state of maturity limbo that is being 18 or 19 or so, pandoria, zeke, and morag are basically just different versions of the oh shit i'm actually a proper adult now vibe that being in your mid-to-late 20s brings, while brighid and dromarch are the two actually full-fledged adults and azurda lives up to his nickname. poppi is a bit harder to pin down for obvious reasons and we don't talk about tora might seem a bit odd to highlight it so much but it's so notable to me though because if i'm to be honest it's something that the jrpg genre as a whole and to a lesser extent even the other games in the xenoblade series tends to really struggle with.

I'm still trying to find the rhythm of a conversation, but somehow I just can't seem to get into the groove. Even when I finally manage to join the discussion, it feels like I'm stuck in an infinite loop of small talk. And then there's this gnawing sense of uncertainty that hangs around like a perpetual shadow. I'm not even sure what I'm expecting from these conversations anymore. It's as if my brain is hardwired to anticipate disappointment, so the thought of engaging with others feels like an exercise in futility.

I'm not one of those people who can easily get out of bed, you know? I mean, when you're stuck in this vicious cycle, it's hard to find a way to break free. But what I've discovered is that sometimes the best way to escape is by embracing your own flaws. It's funny how we often try to hide ourselves from the rest of the world but ironically end up seeking solace from our own reflection. Maybe it's time to stop being so hard on ourselves and instead focus on the things that make us who we are.

- if having consistent subscription revenue lets them lower the iap prices and gives them more resources to fix bugs, then i'm all for it. reliable revenue could mean they could focus on longer-term things rather than expensive, one-time cosmetic purchases. heck, even access to free random instrument spells would be kind of cool since only 1 3 of all instruments are permanently available.

- i believe that there was a third son in the desmond family. this revealed that the donovan was the prime minister during the war. considering this is about 20 or so years out from when spy x family takes place, that puts donovan and melinda as being in their late 40s- early 50s. demetrius would have been born about 15-16 years ago when they would have been in their mid 30s to early 40s. in the context of a political marriage, that's pretty late for them to have had a family. to that end, i believe that they had a son before this from during their 20s-early 30s. what happened to this child is hard to say, but i have a feeling that this one was also killed either during the war or as a casualty of the post-war power transfers and fallout. i would also make a prediction that demetrius is aware his older sibling having existed, but not damien himself.

- do we know how michael and harry met? he is introduced in the third book but they already have a working relationship at that point. i've always assumed he was one of the allies harry mentions not being able to call in during storm front. is there any info out there about them meeting? michael's reaction at first meeting harry on the job is probably amusing enough to explore.

- karen- even if she is wrong she must feel superior. whether it is lake superior depends on how close you live to it.

- i actually would do that deal but like i told someone else- they probably would ve wanted atleast 2 of our unprotected picks. not sure if it s worth it for a role player.

- if you are a poor college student don t spend your money on nods. there is so many other things that will pay off better in the long run. what you should do with 12-1400 in the bank right now. 1. pay off any credit card debt high interest student loans 2. start an ira buy bonds 3. put it in a high interest savings account this are all better options than buying shitty night vision. once you get out of college, start a career, and have some play money then invest in some quality nods.

- for me both are foreign languages, so i naturally watched it in japanese first. to me those are the original sounds of the characters. the english dub to me sounds equally weird as when i'm seeing a spanish or german dub of a famous hollywood actor. it doesn't matter how good they are supposed to be, they just sound wrong. but also, you do still hear their voices when you have the subtitles, don't you? i'd say the voices have personality and convey the message. but most importantly, you know what they are saying because the subtitles are there.

- marshmallows originally did come from the marsh mallow. the root was cut into small pieces, usually boiled, then soaked in honey. marshmallows were used for treating sore throats. a french entrepreneur decided to recreate them, but could not get the root, so they used basically what was a meringue instead. the sugar based marshmallows were cheaper, how most europeans were introduced to the 'food', and easier to make, store, and ship, so they became the default version. i want to make the original version some year,hence all the research, but have not had luck growing the marsh mallow.

It's interesting to see how people react when they find out their own diagnosis. Some are relieved, some are indifferent, and others become defensive. It's like they're trying to prepare themselves for the rest of their lives. I've come across people who just accept it and move on with their lives. They realize that their life isn't defined by a label, no matter how big or small it may be.",200,0.8,0.95,40,1.1,0,0,['</s>'],Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct.IQ1_S.gguf

- yes, there are only 4 black f50 s in the world, per multiple sources online. however, u eintier pointed out that this one is likely wrapped so it is probably a boring old red f50.

- the logo deffo needs some work done to it, it s not our current logo she just did a quick mock-up for it.

- my 2 favourite comments from you on your last point that contradict the whole thing and show you're just a compulsive liar. 'i didn't share my account though, i just stopped playing because i couldn't get in my account, then after 3 days.' then same thread, 'niantic even emailed me saying it was my fault my account was spoofing or some shit. fucking idiots.' god i love pgsharp users.

- wikis ownik is the polish version of wiktionnary. it's great because you have all the cases for every words. and when i need to type a polish specific letter like i either do it from my phone or go to google translate and copy and paste that word or letter.

- would have been great if we had responded to it we.i don't understand. - the witness i don't even have time to explain why i don't have time to explain. - the guardian. roll credits.

- this answer wasn t even really a biased opinion, weird downvoters. looking at how the devs are going for an old school vibe, don t think they re considering sbmm.

- beyond an idiot, especially taking the religion into consideration, and his particular views and motivations. that being said, has zero bearing on the academic prowess of the university or it's students. i'm sure many that attend are not religious zealots or the dumber of people, it's more culture for many american christians than anything else.

- you re too kind but don t be nervous! it takes me a lot of courage to socialize with people as well.

- my flashbulb memory for 9 11 is more like a spotlight as i was across the street that day. ugh.

- sam bankman-fried who is jewish has been intentionally drawn in the style of the antisemitic hands clasped jew caricature popular in nazi circles. that subreddit also recently rose to controversy when transphobic, and misogynistic posts were shared there. i don't think your ideology is welcome here.

I've been noticing this weird pattern where I'd get completely absorbed in certain activities, like a favorite video game or even cleaning my room. It's as if nothing else exists when I'm in that zone. It's both liberating and terrifying - I feel like I'm surrendering to some kind of instinctual autopilot. My mind starts racing with all these arbitrary associations, almost like I'm linking together unrelated ideas on a subconscious level. Sometimes, I'd find myself lost in thought for hours, totally oblivious to my surroundings. It's both freeing and confounding at the same time.",200,0.8,0.95,40,1.1,0,0,['</s>'],Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct.IQ1_S.gguf

- never having been to the state fair for your game, i think the scene at the worlds largest cocktail party is the best scene in college football. this is the second time the game will go home and home for second time in the last 30 years for stadium renovations. i m ok with this as long as the game always stays in jacksonville, as a bulldog who has seen more losses than wins and still wants to be there says to me at least it s a great environment and needs to be left alone.

- i also sold my bag of algo but for slightly different reasons. i only had a very small bag to begin with anyway and i was considering it as part of my downsized portfolio but it didn't make the cut at the end of the day. i have nothing against it and i think it's a great project but i suppose what tipped the balance at the end of the day was that i'd missed the sign up for the next governance period. i was really interested in it and wanted to take part but equally i wanted to rebalance my portfolio to include more coins that i could stake with and wasn't willing to wait around for algo. i'd like to pick it up again down theine if the price doesn't take off before i get there but right now i have other priorities.

- i actually enjoy using reddit because it keeps me extremely honest. it also helps me keep my finger on the pulse of what consumers are concerned with. my posts don't break any of the rules of this sub. have i gotten business from these posts? absolutely. but i don't come on here and bombard people with ads saying to use me. the only thing i bombard people with is value.

- man. i just finished final fantasy xv today and jumped straight into the final fantasy xvi demo. just, wow! what a difference it makes when a cutscene is well integrated into the gameplay and the characters talk about what's happening in the story, compared to those mmorpg-like dialogues from xv. i don't know if my disappointment with ffxv is making all the qualities of ffxvi stand out, but i'm getting goty vibes i know it's a game from last year . ffxv set the bar so low that i'm falling in love with every little thing xvi does right.

- does the content if the wheel change every time you spin? i ve only tried when a huge was present and after one spin it always changes to a potion or similar.

- same. reboot after install fixed it. i also couldn't get my time off utc until a reboot.

- there is an emblem on the card behind the car. supers are gold. regular treasure hunts are silver. there is a emblem on the car, but it s tough to see on this one.

- it had been cold, minus 7 two days before i did the hike and snowed heavily. however the day i did it the weather was warm and sunny. it s just that the snow hadn t melted on one side of the mountain!

- my flashbulb memory for 9 11 is more like a spotlight as i was across the street that day. ugh.

- my buddy helped me build a pc on cyberpower and picked the 3080 for me. i m just now realizing that there are so many variations of it made by different companies i presume? and so you said you just picked the one listing for the 3080 but there are numerous ones that can end up being shipped with my build? so confused lol but having an lcd on the side of my house would be sick lol.

I've been noticing this odd sensation lately, where I'd zone out entirely from conversations. It feels like my brain's on autopilot, just going through motions. Even when someone's talking to me, I'm not really there; it's as if I'm stuck in some sort of haze. That haze tends to lift only for a brief moment before the cycle repeats. I've come to realize I'm not really engaging with people anymore - I'm more like an observer, sitting on the sidelines.

- it should be ranged type since vb is already melee type. it doesn't matter at all that there is already a ranged type beerus since it is a extreme unit, not a sparking one.

I'm not sure why I suddenly became fascinated with the idea of speedrunning through video games. It's like, I'd just gotten this new game and I was already searching for shortcuts in it. Now I'm obsessed with finding routes that are faster than the ones I've already found. Maybe it's because I'm trying to prove something to myself - that I can be more efficient and competent. Whatever the reason is, I'm hooked now.

- that s literally criticism my guy i was asking a simple question out of curiosity. no one asked you to be a dick and treat me like an idiot. obviously i don t expect anyone to just leave it there like wtf. obviously it s disposed of but i m asking how other people do it. plenty of people responded to the same question without criticism and gave helpful answers. you just sat here and taunted me for my question. again that s criticism.

- nice vibe. simple four on the floor kick pattern. the tail end of the kick can be cut down a bit to clean up the bass frequency of the song. the subbiness from the kick distracts me from listening to other element a bit. the slidey synth in the first part can be pushed forward a bit. that element feels like the first character of the track and if it's hiding behind all the drum track, it kinda loses its purpose. i do dig the strong kick though, but i think the other element can shine a bit more without sacrificing the oomph of the kick. a lot of interesting ideas by the way. love the way the track moves around in my head. all the element feels like it supports each other. just a minor adjustment during mixing process and i think this can be something enjoyable to listen to. great job.

- lol yeah hey. i did my fair share of taunting you guys so i deserved any shouts you threw at me.

- honestly, warlords of draenor had the most satisfying leveling experience of each expansion when it was current. each zone gave you a choice of new actions to use once you'd unlocked that zone's outpost, the world treasures were all unique moments of environmental storytelling and the toys you got as a result were fantastic loot-a-rang smoothed looting from a distance even for non-engineers, the launching totem and slow-fall toys gave a new transportation option in the days before flight would be accessible, the garrison hearthstone let you mix up your personal hearthing strategy while still having a quick return to your base of operations, but most importantly wod is the expansion that introduced the flight master's whistle. with the click of a button, you were whisked away to the nearest flight master. when leveling without flying, it was magnificent. now if it seems like i'm focusing on the movement options over everything else, you might conclude that an expansion like dragonflight should be my favorite, since it gives flying just a few quests into the first zone. and that's reasonable! dragonflight might very well unseat wod for me, some day. but wod had such a perfect mix of obstacles and tools to mitigate those obstacles that i had more fun questing there than anywhere else. if you already have flying, though, all that goes out the window. then it's something like dragonflight wod mop bfa legion shadowlands cataclysm wotlk tbc.

- this is what i was waiting to see. from a personal perspective, i don't like that roster slots are being spent on guest characters. however, i have to recognize that they are selling huge numbers. if they expand the player base and keep the game thriving, i can't ignore their utility.

- selling loewe puzzle from jipin factory and strap. in perfect condition. paid 275usd for both selling for 265 usd plus shipping to canada or usa.

- i think that's the only episode that features him. there's a bit more prequel era stuff in the following episodes, but on the whole this mainly focuses on the original trilogy. luke vs. emperor palpatine - rise to evil yoda vs count dooku size matters not jedi vs. sith - the skywalker saga yoda the jedi master.

- gpt and paper bring any idea or play any role. can use rpg handbook as source materials and has an internal database for characters and uses the code interpreter for skill checks.

- can someone explain why emily is adamantly claiming discovery has not started? i don t work in the legal world and trying to understand why there are two extremely different versions of the status of the case.

- explain this, lol if you'd show the whole interview, you'll also see that he told that they think that the hamas shot the rocket absolute clown .

- maybe there will be a future mass effect just for this plothole. mass effect the illusive slimness.

- this tower was by shop architects, while 270 park was a foster and partners design. both designs were unveiled or leaked in 2018, so the resemblance is most likely a coincidence.

- i'm so sorry! but i can't make them printed since i'm from argentina and it's very complicated to send them out of the country.

- maybe i can, but all the material i've found online is geared towards contractors placing a lien against a homeowner.

- i meant that i didn t expect to see such beautiful views so close to san jose sf where i was staying. i ve seen a ton of pictures of the ggb and such, so i expected that. if that makes sense? i knew ca was breathtaking, but i thought that was down towards big sur. stupidity on my part really - my first time to ca.

- it's going to be some time before i get back to this.

- both are on ps plus extra, which one should i play first? which one is the more fun? elden ring was my first fromsoftware game and i really like these type of games.

- anyone here who usually scores good marks but constantly made silly mistakes in mathematics and science? if so, how did you overcome this shortcoming how do you plan on overcoming it? i consistently lose 1st rank in class due to silly mistakes in mathematics and science, like a simple calculation mistake, random ,- thing, 2 3 8.

- i couldn't wipe the smile off my face after stevie j got caught holding the ball. he couldn't believe it.

- it may or may not work for your situation, but what worked for me when i had a fulltime job was to work on my games for 3 hours prior to going into working the job mode. that said some jobs are more demanding than others so it might not work.

- it was above 0 celsius today and my friends gas driven airsoft guns worked fine.

- i am in kansas, and i saw this crawling on my window inside! i could not get a good picture at all, but it looked like an ant with wings? but it was kinda big too. it was black, and pretty big actually.

- that ll buy him a single order of wings and a cold glass of labatt blue.

- i agree with maverick. figure out what kind of sorceress your friend is going to be playing, and try to use a different damage type. also, a sorceress is pretty squishy, so something that can absorb some damage would be useful. if you are the type of player that likes to whack at enemies one by one, a zeal paladin or barbarian can be fun. if you prefer casters, wind druids can be strong with basic equipment and have pretty beefy summons.

- dude. those are the games i played when i was a kid. good days. thank you so much. if you want to check out my other stuff, you can check out my youtube channel right here. i have variety of projects i'm working on currently.

- so i'm kinda waiting in line, and i'm wondering what you all doing. by the way, love you all cones!

- planetary dungeons equivalent of derelict freighters but more combat oriented, such as large sentinel facilities, old forgotten gek and vy'keen ruins with spooky creatures dwelling in them. space station ownership they already added the terminal and station override. maybe allow us to claim them for a high price. allow different player hubs more officially establish themselves.

- wikis ownik is the polish version of wiktionnary. it's great because you have all the cases for every words. and when i need to type a polish specific letter like i either do it from my phone or go to google translate and copy and paste that word or letter.

- i also sold my bag of algo but for slightly different reasons. i only had a very small bag to begin with anyway and i was considering it as part of my downsized portfolio but it didn't make the cut at the end of the day. i have nothing against it and i think it's a great project but i suppose what tipped the balance at the end of the day was that i'd missed the sign up for the next governance period. i was really interested in it and wanted to take part but equally i wanted to rebalance my portfolio to include more coins that i could stake with and wasn't willing to wait around for algo. i'd like to pick it up again down theine if the price doesn't take off before i get there but right now i have other priorities.

- hard to tell from the pictures, but is it rusting because there was a paint chip there? if so, just remove the surface rust and apply some touch up paint to prevent it from spreading.

- also something i missed, but with the whole weasel woo debacle, i don't know how much respect woo has over kass. kass at least made an actual game move, while woo was kind of breaking the rules.

- at this point we need a free release about the size of the 30th anniversary pack that focuses exclusively on the core playlists. i know nobody wants to know gambit exists but there's no excuse for gambit to have no new maps since forsaken with still no news of getting any maps anytime soon. if it takes bungie scrapping one of their seasons and making another six-month long season for this to happen then go for it, but what is labeled both by bungie and the players as the core of the game should not be the weakest part of it every single year.

- i mean, don't say of course it's covered since you didn't specify, and you certainly left out a lot of details about your overall position and trade that drastically change whether rolling is a good or bad idea. if you're happy with it and understand all the ramifications and risks, do it.

- people really love to over exaggerate how dated megaman legends' actually is. the controls are not the best, but they're not terribly hard to wrap your head around and they certainly are not tank controls. you use the d-pad to move megaman and the l1 r1 buttons to rotate the camera left and right. the game was designed around these controls so you don't have to worry about looking up and down too much. x is jump, square is shoot, triangle is special weapon, and o is interact. the game has two forms of lock on. the first and one you use the most is the soft-lock which works by just keeping the camera facing whatever you want to shoot and megaman will just shoot at it. the other lock on is a hard-lock which you use by holding down r2. while using it you can't move and the camera tracks the enemy you lock on too. you don't use this a lot, so don't worry about it too much. legends 1 can absolutely be recommended in good conscious. just give whoever your recommending it to a heads up about the lack of analog control and they should be fine. also, this is a problem exclusive to legends 1 since legends 2 does have traditional analog control as well as a traditional lock-on.

- i loved sharing my spells with the moths i adopted and take around with me when i played. now tho it's become rather hard with the few spells we get each event. with the 6 ones, we once used to receive, i was using them for much longer and it didn't feel like a waste? if that makes sense to use them. the time is limited af for each spell. if they gonna give less than half the old number of spells how about you increase the time limit of the spells? idk if i'm the only one feeling like this is a disappointing change but yea. if this is still glitch then it should not be taking them months to fix this small thing.

- the one i want. it looks super cool but i want an automatic with sign led.

- huh, i've never heard much praise for it but neither heard that it's horrible. what's no good about it? any potential for mods making it nicer?

- i have that identical knife, probably 10 years old i had no clue i owned it and found it recently, great little knife!

- all that does is reduce the resale value. if your coins get stolen, it's unlikely that you'll see them again anyway.

- i genuinely can't wait to get to nsw and ld, and pic too.

- i'm getting to a skill level where the models need shaping at the end. i'm wondering if there is any advantage or disadvantage to shaping with mc. i'm using tissue paper backed tracing paper. my thoughts are that the mc is going to have a stronger hold then just the water? i'm not sure if this is no different than plain water so i figured i'd ask. what does the reddit have to say on my thoughts?

- why is there so little awareness or education about the rules for stand-offs when multiple cars approach a mini roundabout at the same time? no one i've pointed it out to has been already aware that one junction will be marked with double 'give way' lines on them. give way lines.

- get him a ninebot g30, he can learn to hack it to make it go from 25kmh to 33kmh stock. it feels pretty good as a kid making your scooter go faster the g30 has huge huge huuuggeee market of parts, you could make a g30 into a beast thst out performs a lot of other scooters. reason i m saying this is because he can grow up to like 14, learn stuff about electronics, put a more powerful battery motor on it, put suspension on it, and learn heaps of stuff. the g30 is quite a loved scooter, for its stock form but especially its aftermarket potential.

- if you are a poor college student don t spend your money on nods. there is so many other things that will pay off better in the long run. what you should do with 12-1400 in the bank right now. 1. pay off any credit card debt high interest student loans 2. start an ira buy bonds 3. put it in a high interest savings account this are all better options than buying shitty night vision. once you get out of college, start a career, and have some play money then invest in some quality nods.

- i actually enjoy using reddit because it keeps me extremely honest. it also helps me keep my finger on the pulse of what consumers are concerned with. my posts don't break any of the rules of this sub. have i gotten business from these posts? absolutely. but i don't come on here and bombard people with ads saying to use me. the only thing i bombard people with is value.

- i don't have time for punctuation, i'm a hoopy frood and you can bet your bottom dollar i know exactly where my towel is. i just wanted to share and enjoy.

- i feel like this particular show is a little overrated based on how often it comes up . it's a case of glory guitar on jerry's part, whereby rather than putting in the hard work all over the fretboard, he sometimes opted to just go for the high-register glory notes. to me, the payoffs weren't as satisfying when they felt a little unearned. anyway, not a bad show, but not quite up to the level of red rocks, starlight or alpine from earlier in the tour.

- would this team work with xingqui instead of yelan? also, about the shiels stuff, how do you deal or team vs multiple enemies. consistent dps vs one enemy is okay but vs multiple enemies, shield is a must? team recommendation vs multiple enemies? maybe switch sucrose for beidou?

- google is also against affiliate, paid guest post and sponsored links. if i remove ads, i will not be able to pay the server cost.

- the term golden age referances so much more then who is stronger. it would be an age of sorcerers who control the people, while normal people make up a small percent of the population. an age of jujutsu innovation, de, hwb, da. sukuna was surprised that jogo didn't know what his ct was but on second thought remembered in his time there where very few cursed spirits as the bulk of people didn't contribute to there creation. to ask if it was an era of stronger people the short answer is yes on average just because the ratio of sorcerer to non was so vastly different. the long answer becomes alot more complicated as we only get to see who kenny picked and not the strong who have already fallen or rejected the offer of reincarnation or if you will dominating another's soul most in a good alignment would of likely attempted to kill kenny.

- it definitely is. best sustain roaming super in the game, has excellent ability to stagger enemies and is excellent at getting in and out of dangerous positions.

- marshmallows originally did come from the marsh mallow. the root was cut into small pieces, usually boiled, then soaked in honey. marshmallows were used for treating sore throats. a french entrepreneur decided to recreate them, but could not get the root, so they used basically what was a meringue instead. the sugar based marshmallows were cheaper, how most europeans were introduced to the 'food', and easier to make, store, and ship, so they became the default version. i want to make the original version some year,hence all the research, but have not had luck growing the marsh mallow.

- well, like anton said, a timed event is a little tricky, with all the different timezones; doing another one at 07 00 pst is a good idea but some people could cheat looking at the image at 19 00, then submit at 07 00 to be the fastest or maybe at 15 00 pst ? so it would be at midnight for europeans ? it's the first time i'm doing this, so i need all the feedback i can get.

- guillotine will come in handy when you fight one of the act 8 bosses can't remember which one but her r3 ends the last phase in 1 shot, otherwise you have to hit him her a crapload of times.

- my flashbulb memory for 9 11 is more like a spotlight as i was across the street that day. ugh.

- dude can block much taller player's 3 point shot while standing near the key. i'm not so sure she would get off a step back.

- i actually would do that deal but like i told someone else- they probably would ve wanted atleast 2 of our unprotected picks. not sure if it s worth it for a role player.

- tesla's days of inventory is around 18, average in auto industry is around 70.

- just to let ya'll know donna's jury selection date has been moved forward a day to monday 16th september, so it looks like actual testimony will start hopefully by wednesday. this was confirmed by katiecoolady earlier today.

- get him a ninebot g30, he can learn to hack it to make it go from 25kmh to 33kmh stock. it feels pretty good as a kid making your scooter go faster the g30 has huge huge huuuggeee market of parts, you could make a g30 into a beast thst out performs a lot of other scooters. reason i m saying this is because he can grow up to like 14, learn stuff about electronics, put a more powerful battery motor on it, put suspension on it, and learn heaps of stuff. the g30 is quite a loved scooter, for its stock form but especially its aftermarket potential.

- not sure how demanding this release will be, i don't think the site will have issues. i'll be ordering tonight when the new sets become available. countach, bumblebee and iron man brickhead for me.

- i have the plan, but i don't have the time to farm the materials to craft it, and yes i know it's not a lot.

- rome and madrid are in my top 3 city tracks. they just flow so excellently well on 200cc, maybe that s why i like the city tracks as much as i do. they re all a blast on 200.

- if products don't help, maybe it's got something to do with your diet. avoid eating oily foods, avoid drinking high fat milk, meats, too much sugar or egg yolks. try cucumber and salads with high water content. try this eating routine for a few weeks, and if it doesn't help, try a dermatologist.

- trees rab sounds like he s doing that tongue thing when he says silent. like overusing his tongue.

- unfortunately that s the modern gamer apparently lol and idk maybe but i think it s unfair to judge it on a couple shorts as a we got gog at home lol plus the star child drax short was pretty funny. but they has like dozens of shorts i doubt they re all leaning in that direction.

- i loved sharing my spells with the moths i adopted and take around with me when i played. now tho it's become rather hard with the few spells we get each event. with the 6 ones, we once used to receive, i was using them for much longer and it didn't feel like a waste? if that makes sense to use them. the time is limited af for each spell. if they gonna give less than half the old number of spells how about you increase the time limit of the spells? idk if i'm the only one feeling like this is a disappointing change but yea. if this is still glitch then it should not be taking them months to fix this small thing.

- thanks again. i watched the israel segments of the show first half . and, i have to agree with you. this was a very poor showing from douglas. he was flippant about the west bank settlements and the suffering of those palestinians. and he was curiously dismissive of the concerns that israeli protesters are raising against bibi for his failures. douglas reverted back twice to the fact that israel is a democracy and thus its leaders are subject to public pressure as some kind of unfair disadvantage in conducting the war given that hamas no longer permits elections. that s a bit rich given that the strength of western support hinges on the fact that israel remains a democracy. thanks again for alerting me to the interview. i hope sam will watch it too.

- i checked his profile and he looks legit naman, may friends. when he messaged me hindi siya insistent na magbayad agad before ordering like the scams nakikita ko about paypal. gusto niya lang magpagawa and ship it to the us pero sabi ko i don't provide international shipping but will consider offering it soon mga next month, but he was like can you do it next week. syempre ako nataranta kasi hala sayang naman yung opportunity dapat talaga aralin ko na yung international shipping ' . thank you sa awareness! will be careful pag nagstart na ako magship internationally.

- ireland. would help a lot to get me to the end of the month.

- confirming an order and canceling should equate to termination. if you re not ready or willing to sell your shoes you should confirm an order.

- trump supporters. i understand trump kinda but i have no clue how people can think he's the answer.

- thank you so much for this information. i agree, rankings are pretty arbitrary in the grand scheme of things. i also understand that it's not a good idea to look at graduate schools by general reputation, such as harvard, for example. i've seen on this sub that oftentimes those prestigious schools don't even have io faculty qualified to actually teach it specifically, i remember a recent complaint about columbia . so, that brings me to a follow-up question how do we determine which schools have good io programs and qualified faculty? especially if i don't have a particular passion for an io topic. yes, i'm interested in io and i can see myself working in the field. honestly, i just want to go to a good grad school for io that won't leave me in debt. the specifics don't matter. hence, why i was hoping the rankings could be some sort of guide. not sure if this reply is all over the place or makes sense, but thanks again for your original reply!

- you could still transition into ts without omni if you want, or even with omni if you want to really minmax the build. i'm personally just sticking with la because it already does all i want from it and i'm planning to reroll to some other build once i decide what i wanna work on for the rest of the league.

- it's so hard to get convicted of bribery these days, you almost have to be cartoonishly obvious about it. i mean, gold bars? only way he could've been more on the nose is if it had been a sack with a dollar sign on it.

- tennessee. lots of options for reasonably priced real estate, many lakes and no state tax which means you get an automatic pay raise of 5 or more.

- a lot more goes into shelf planning than folks realize. margin dollars don t have taste buds. that said, i still don t like my favs on the bottom shelf!

- senior consultant at boutique consulting firm, tier 1 college, average academics, good work ex, excellent rating across the board, 2 quick promotions and multiple awards. still i'm unable to get a crack at any consulting position. what should i focus on? based out of india.

""I've been noticing lately that I'm not myself anymore. My daily routine is just a blur of tasks, like running on autopilot. I'm exhausted even when I'm not doing anything. The things that used to give me pleasure now feel like an obligation. And those close to me seem to be walking away, leaving me with this feeling of being alone in the dark room. It's all about trying to find a way back to myself, but it feels like climbing a never-ending staircase.""

- with the greatest of respect, you are the type of person i am talking about, with regards to being hypocritical and selfish. you're on one hand complaining about group players being punished in the pit, but on the other hand, claiming that solo players being punished by bossing.a much more severe punishment by the way, is perfectly fine. you're complaining that the pit is 50 slower for a group player than a solo player. yet you can't see the problem that a solo player is 400 slower than a group player for bossing.

- i want to. never have any days fully off of incredible responsibility. it will happen though. maybe i will just give it a go and see if i can keep up. if i can t i ll go back to the long grueling taper and keep on.

- to clarify, a squib won't directly cause this. a squib is a round stuck somewhere between chamber and muzzle. as others have said, it's a pop swoosh not a bang with less felt recoil. it will usually not cycle a semi-auto firearm. i've seen 1 2 a dozen in 30 years or shooting and almost as many as an instructor. saw one on a fa tommy on a form 4 once. guy almost squeezed the trigger before hearing me yell the line cold because of it. he was incredibly lucky i heard the classic swoosh from the other side of the line. if you shoot another round through a barrel that is obstructed by a squib or something else , this could happen. it could also happen if the round ignites outside of battery. surprised no one has mentioned that.

- sure. if it turns out ok. i'm slow, don't hold your breath . pm me your an address and i'll send you the sketch if you want . when it's dry.

- a lot more goes into shelf planning than folks realize. margin dollars don t have taste buds. that said, i still don t like my favs on the bottom shelf!

- i feel like this particular show is a little overrated based on how often it comes up . it's a case of glory guitar on jerry's part, whereby rather than putting in the hard work all over the fretboard, he sometimes opted to just go for the high-register glory notes. to me, the payoffs weren't as satisfying when they felt a little unearned. anyway, not a bad show, but not quite up to the level of red rocks, starlight or alpine from earlier in the tour.

- gpt and paper bring any idea or play any role. can use rpg handbook as source materials and has an internal database for characters and uses the code interpreter for skill checks.

- in fact, can we collect all known lore about land octopi and the vulgar militia here? i'm doing my best to find more lore about them besides they were smol .

- go into airplane mode before starting the game. the game will tell you that there is no internet and do you want to go into offline mode.

- and yet, either god is really wishy-washy taffy pulling all over the place. or they ain t speaking directly to him for him! both are problematic!

- boris nadezhdin has now been officially banned from running as a candidate in russia s upcoming election due to signature irregularities . there are now zero anti war candidates running in the next election. russian democracy at its finest.

- even for the richest. living lavishly while the rest of the country suffer is not a magnificent life unless you have no conscience.

- hard to tell from the pictures, but is it rusting because there was a paint chip there? if so, just remove the surface rust and apply some touch up paint to prevent it from spreading.

I'm constantly finding myself lost in the midst of my daily routine. It's as if I'm perpetually stuck on autopilot, never truly engaging with the world around me. The most mundane tasks become an uphill battle, and even the simplest pleasures are reduced to hollow, unfulfilling experiences. Sometimes I catch myself staring blankly into space, wondering what it means to be alive.

- methodology with help from u hosea0220, who is an accomplished data scientist and also happens to be my wife , we she wrote a code using python and praw. the code pulls the top 1000 posts from the past 24 hours 2pm - 2pm cst , here at r cryptocurrency, analyzing for any coins specifically mentioned. from which, the total number and resulting ranking is produced. we built a reference database for the tool utilizing coingecko, which includes the top 300 coins by market cap plus moon coin . please upvote if you'd like us to continue posting these updates!

- sadly i'm not 100 sure i would do smt for any of those that i listed. looking for something that i really want for that one. i'm sorry. is there anything else that might interest you for those 2 mainly?

- what is your country of citizenship? if u.s., then the countries i m gonna travel to line in the application doesn t matter at all unless you gave a country like cuba or north korea, perhaps. it s fine to only include the countries where you ll be going through immigration which would exclude most layovers but it really doesn t matter. even if your plans changed completely, say, you wrote albania when you applied, but you end of going to zimbabwe instead, it won t make one bit of difference. to be honest, i m not sure why the dos even asks for this. most likely it s to keep a rough count of americans in various countries in case of disasters.

- i actually enjoy using reddit because it keeps me extremely honest. it also helps me keep my finger on the pulse of what consumers are concerned with. my posts don't break any of the rules of this sub. have i gotten business from these posts? absolutely. but i don't come on here and bombard people with ads saying to use me. the only thing i bombard people with is value.

I've been noticing that I'm frequently drawn to topics that are a bit too far out there, like why we're all silently obsessed with the concept of time. Or how some people seem to have an innate fear of being late for appointments by even half an hour. There's this sensation that I can't quite shake - that these minor issues are somehow interconnected, and I've started to wonder if my fascination with these obscure topics is linked to the way I perceive reality in general.

There's no denying that some folks might find this all a bit too esoteric, but what strikes me as significant is the underlying pattern of human behavior. Are we, as individuals, just randomly drifting through our existences, or do our choices and decisions boil down to something more profound? This sense of mystery seems to be at the forefront of my thoughts lately.

- you could say that about most all the steakhouses in chicago, the margin is crazy high. i get it, there s a reason why i haven t been out to a steakhouse in years, but i think joes pricing is pretty much market and not different from any other steakhouse.

- maybe there's a makerspace or a club in your area . doing that by hand is insane unless you got arms like kingkong.

- what are the pitfalls of moving to uae as opposed to staying in india from investments and future earnings perspective? i had couple of job offers from uae firms and it pays significantly well when converted to indian currency bad metric to consider, i know . standard of living is pretty good too. it is expensive so does not translate into savings much as expected. gdp per capita pretty high compared to india, doesn t translate into growth in future down the line as per my calculations. i was thinking of moving there for few years, make money and come back to india or move elsewhere. is this a wise thing to do? priorities personal growth, economic development and investment opportunities.

- it definitely is. best sustain roaming super in the game, has excellent ability to stagger enemies and is excellent at getting in and out of dangerous positions.

- archery fighting style and sharpshooter, that s the whole build. throw some points into wisdom to beef up your pool of grit points.

- they are pretty much out of stock everywhere. i bought a 128 one for 530 due to price inflation.

- i gotta say, deep south is one of the best commentaries that i like to start with when i sleep. i typically put on a playlist of commentaries that will last the night, and the deep south is a popular starter for me. any favorites among you?

- umm, link? i've searched around i wouldn't have asked if i hadn't but wasn't able to find anything.

- for weight loss, i've been very happy with combining btb with water and mixing unflavored protein powder and bone broth. then you have a fantastic tasting protein broth that's filling. such a good alternative to all the sweet protein shakes out there.

- my stand in is definitely the biggest hit this year. i have my issues with it, but it is undeniably a good watch. unknown was definitely good, made me blush so many times. dff was good but also very sad. wandee gooday is also good but has editing issues.

- orbital will be better i think. a belt sander can get away from you quickly unless you have a good bit to sand down. also the orbital will give you a smooth finish as you progress thru the grits.

- i think the smallest 4k plasma they were able to make was 142 . they couldn't get the pixels small enough to do consumer sized tv's, and oled was just better with the infinite blacks. kind of the same issue that is facing microled tvs, they haven't been able to scale it down.

But what can you do when you feel stuck? Sometimes all we need is someone to talk to, but who do you turn to when you're surrounded by people who don't understand the struggle?

2. You know, sometimes I wonder why people even bother with relationships. It's like they're setting themselves up for disappointment. But then again, maybe that's just me talking. Maybe I'm just not cut out for this romantic relationship thing.

3. Yeah, it seems to me like you're really getting worked up over nothing. I mean, seriously, you need to calm down and reflect on your life before making any rash decisions. Sometimes things aren't as bad as they seem, but we just don't realize that.

- afaik most helmets are adjustable to a degree, at least all the ones i've had have a sort of wheel behind the head that tightens loosens it. if i tighten it it fits right without the hat, if i loosen it it fits perfectly with the hat. and i didn't feel hotter with it than without but maybe it can feel that way.

- but why? kion x fuli are perfect for each other, lol only 2 types of people exist, kion x fuli shippers, and kion x rani shipper, and i will never join kion x rani shippers because every last of them are traitors and i will never join them meaning i will never ship kion x rani .

- thank you so much for this information. i agree, rankings are pretty arbitrary in the grand scheme of things. i also understand that it's not a good idea to look at graduate schools by general reputation, such as harvard, for example. i've seen on this sub that oftentimes those prestigious schools don't even have io faculty qualified to actually teach it specifically, i remember a recent complaint about columbia . so, that brings me to a follow-up question how do we determine which schools have good io programs and qualified faculty? especially if i don't have a particular passion for an io topic. yes, i'm interested in io and i can see myself working in the field. honestly, i just want to go to a good grad school for io that won't leave me in debt. the specifics don't matter. hence, why i was hoping the rankings could be some sort of guide. not sure if this reply is all over the place or makes sense, but thanks again for your original reply!

- definitely gremory vs. bael in the sitri game the object severely neutered the entire gremory team as a whole which was cool learning experience for rias but other than that really lame tbh cause sona had such a big advantage at that point. it was still a great match especially to see how smart sona was and how her peerage responds to that. my 2 favorite rating games are from much farther in the series so spoiler alert !the much better match vs sona was sona vs issei it showed how the best girl of the series, ravel, was as good if not better than sona at tactics. on top of that the 1 v 1 vs saji was soooo gooood. the emotion was off the charts.the other really great rating game was issei vs rias. there were just so many emotions with grayfia, xenovia, and issei everyone was almost facing their rivals in that match it was also the first time where issei truly felt like an equal to rias and fully worthy to be able to marry her. absolutely loved this rating game.

- gonna be honest, i m not super enamoured by sean payton. he had quite a few mediocre at best seasons with drew brees as his quarterback and even though they re both short, they re wildly different and i m not sure that what payton typically does is a great fit for russ we kinda just saw that with hackett. not to mention if he wants to bring in his own gm, i m not sure no is the front office i want to be poaching from. the narrative is that he and harbaugh are 1a and 1b but, imo, it s a pretty clear 1 and 2. not saying he s necessarily a bad hire but i think the name and the clout of sean payton are a little beyond the tangible results. to me harbaugh s results and football philosophy seem much better aligned with what this team needs, especially for russ to succeed.

- my prior post was unclear. i am not in favor of human intervention by killing any owls.

- sushi the day i got him, he was in a 10 gallon while his current home was being cycled.

- for weight loss, i've been very happy with combining btb with water and mixing unflavored protein powder and bone broth. then you have a fantastic tasting protein broth that's filling. such a good alternative to all the sweet protein shakes out there.

- many people can do it and can do much higher returns. there are many trading contests, the best year-to-day is 150 . i think i only have the ability to ensure 50 . higher than that is difficult.

- that s awesome! hope you took lots of pictures it s a beautiful area, i wish i could have stayed longer.

- blizzard is one of the companies that has long supported and benefited from allowing players to mod their games. you might argue that there have been downsides, such as the birth of competitors like league of legends which was a direct outcome of the popularity of the defense of the ancients mod for warcraft 3 , but considering how much of blizzard's strength is in adapting innovations from elsewhere and providing one of the best implementations of those innovations, i think the benefits outweigh the risks. giving independent developers the opportunity to make tools for games like hearthstone is just another way for them to attract interest in their games and discover new opportunities for improvement.

- what in tarnations ? that was painfully cringe lol us americans and u canadians sure have a lot in common. idk why this sub been getting recommended but man we have the same politicians and gripes and problems.

- suppose if i sell and the buyer puts up a complaint in bog , wont they freeze bog?

- sadly, i only have the first book. i m planning on getting the other four. alan moore s swamp thing book one is really great though. edit i thought you meant for swamp thing then i realized you meant the collection. no, not really but my top 3 are black mirror, kingdom come and court of owls.

- from my personal experience everyone s may vary based on many factors, like full scope, examiner, ect i had an instance where a girl was heavily drunk, but we had messed around prior to that and after that as well several years to be more accurate .the examiner was totally fine with it. it s moreso things like taking advantage of someone and knowing they probably wouldn t engage otherwise. you will talk about a lot before you are tested to cover those grey areas you may have.

- to all the women in the replies fighting these not all men, comments and sharing your stories i m sorry those horrible things happened to you and they you didn t get the justice you deserve. i hold nothing but love and healing for you.

- would narrow pads work on these mt200 calipers? i assumed there was a limitation when it comes to that. i saw that pads have different shapes and assumed only one type fits each caliper correctly.

- thank you for sharing! interestingly, mine only hurts when i am sitting. i m sure it has to do with my muscles being tight all down my left side. i am scared to not have arch support which would bring back my ankle problems. i am going to work on my arches with exercises. hopefully that helps.

I've noticed that my sleep patterns have been all over the place lately. One night I'm wide awake at 3 AM, thinking I'll get everything done and the next morning I'm still in bed. It's like I'm bouncing between two different people, where one is a productive machine, and another is someone who can't even remember what day it is. 

Try to understand that my life has become this weird dance of contradictions. Sometimes I'm a master chef for the day, and then the next morning I'm too exhausted to even make myself a sandwich. What's going on? Why do I have to be so many different people at once?

I've tried to explain it to myself, but the words just won't come together. It's like my mind is this ever-changing kaleidoscope of thought and action.

- 2k-2k2 was an amazing cycle. the game improved so much each year, even though it was far superior to live.

- planetary dungeons equivalent of derelict freighters but more combat oriented, such as large sentinel facilities, old forgotten gek and vy'keen ruins with spooky creatures dwelling in them. space station ownership they already added the terminal and station override. maybe allow us to claim them for a high price. allow different player hubs more officially establish themselves.

- first, hi man! where have you been? i haven't seen you in a while secondly, can you please add links to your specific topic, there's alot lectures al-haydari made, i didn't know where to begin.

- option 1. spam click around the area about 1 unit away and maybe get lucky option 2. go to edit move the trap you want somewhere else hold click on it click the damage icon when it shows upgrade from there.

- nobody said it was the best. he said it was great and the devs did a good job.

- my criteria is a combination of screentime characterization wins for example, the nightwing in tt had a very small screentime but had great characterization and never had a terrible moment. meanwhile dcamu nightwing had loads of screentime, great characterization but had more ls than wins.

It's not just the tasks themselves; it's how they make me feel. Like, yesterday I spent three hours doing nothing but staring at a blank page, wondering why I wasn't making progress.

The worst part is when I'm in bed and suddenly this tiny thought creeps into my mind, something that would've been an afterthought otherwise, like whether the window was open or if it's raining outside. It's as if these thoughts are taunting me, daring me to react. Sometimes I even wonder what my life would be like without these perpetual worries.

It's not a matter of logic; it's more about feeling overwhelmed and trying to silence that voice inside saying ""you're wasting time.""",200,0.8,0.95,40,1.1,0,0,['</s>'],Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct.IQ1_S.gguf

- i can tell you from experience that it's not that hard of a journey. if there is significant changes made during the surgery it will just take time. i'm confident you will regret your decision and i'm confident that you will be eventually happy you did. walking, jogging and going upstairs are not something you should live without. if you have confidence that you've got the right surgeon, and it's the right time, you're young enough that you should heal just fine. i have friends that have had double knee replacements less than a year ago they're out playing golf today.

- i'm sitting on 4 of these and want to clean some out but really can't decide. a arrowhead, high cal, killing wind, moving target b small bore, extended mag, quickdraw, rampage c corkscrew, extended mag, subsistence, rampage d extended barrel, amor piercing, outlaw, elemental capacitor usually on arc usually for a mix of sixes and trials, but c feels like it could be decent for pve also but i haven't messed with it much.

- i think the issue is in clear view, no nutrient export. or do you add carbon and use a skimmer?

- tennessee. lots of options for reasonably priced real estate, many lakes and no state tax which means you get an automatic pay raise of 5 or more.

- that shit is so unlucky, i know we don t help ourselves out a ton but this has happened a lot to us this season.

- all we can tell you is that s a sativa leaning hybrid. you know it has sativa because of the thin pointy leaves. you know it has some indica because the nodes are close together and she has that dense bushy flower structure that indica brings to the table. looks nice!

- happiness is up there. the way the melody builds as the emotions of the story being told pile up is so well done. the great gatsby references are kind of a mixed bag for me, though. they only really make sense if you don't actually know anything about the novel's themes or ending. it's a weird move from taylor, who's generally very intentional with her metaphors and references.

- first post here, not sure if is appropriate here but bpl are organizing a virtual mario kart 8 tournament this afternoon from 4 to 6. you do need to own mario kart 8 for the switch and have a switch online account to be able to play. my son has played on these a couple of times and they looked like fun social distancing got you down? remote learning stressing you out? got a nintendo switch? join us for bpl's virtual mario kart session! play against your friends and folks from all across brooklyn and dominate the race! all skill levels welcome! no registration required! just search for the tournament bpl tourney or by code 2208-4639-6971 and hop in and out any time you like between 4 pm and 6 pm. pick your favorite character and let's get racing!

- blast burn. but realize that blast burn is a community day move so you can't use a charge tm to learn it. you'd either have to use an elite tm to learn it or evolve into a blaziken to learn it during a special event that allows for it. based on prior history, you'll likely have the opportunity during december's community day. niantic could release it in another fashion but we don't have any information on when and if they would.

- actually sub zero knowing shotokan has been a thing since 2002 or if you mean by older generations as in the 90s but yeye.

- he did not hit the high stand position on the bar. he's gonna lose marks for execution and it might diminish his technical base value.

- these are elite level athletes, at some point it can t be all accidental blows to the head from one side.

- gonna be honest, i m not super enamoured by sean payton. he had quite a few mediocre at best seasons with drew brees as his quarterback and even though they re both short, they re wildly different and i m not sure that what payton typically does is a great fit for russ we kinda just saw that with hackett. not to mention if he wants to bring in his own gm, i m not sure no is the front office i want to be poaching from. the narrative is that he and harbaugh are 1a and 1b but, imo, it s a pretty clear 1 and 2. not saying he s necessarily a bad hire but i think the name and the clout of sean payton are a little beyond the tangible results. to me harbaugh s results and football philosophy seem much better aligned with what this team needs, especially for russ to succeed.

- i'm swedish and not german, but it probably works similarly in germany how does the german government know who to send the ballots to? they are sent to everyone who is eligible for voting here - which is all citizens that are 18 years old. how often are censuses conducted? how does the government take into account recent moves, or people who have recently come of voting age? there are no censuses in sweden. they are unnecessary here. sweden has a national register of all its inhabitants which is always kept updated. it has a registered address for everyone - children will be registered at their parents' address and homeless people will typically have a registered address at for example a church or a municipal office. when you move, you must notify the government of your new address. it is in fact illegal to not do so. and it is in your own best interest to update your registered address - besides the ability to get mail, being registered at the wrong address will interfere with social services and many other things. when you change your address, mail destined for your old address will be forwarded to your new address for a period of time. because of this, none of the things you mentioned are problems in sweden.

- you mean the people who are often in fear of deportation and in dire poverty? it s not much of a choice and it s sad you don t see that.

- you'd be using the pen for twice as long as the manufacturer's guidelines - and would need to go through the various stepping up does to get to a point where the prescriber is willing to issue 15mg. other than that it should work. other problems - prescriber will be on to you pretty quick when you're not re-ordering on the expected schedule may insist on you going back to 2.5mg . i'm not sure the saving is worth the potential issues hassle - but technically the theory is sound ish .

- senior consultant at boutique consulting firm, tier 1 college, average academics, good work ex, excellent rating across the board, 2 quick promotions and multiple awards. still i'm unable to get a crack at any consulting position. what should i focus on? based out of india.

- thanks again. i watched the israel segments of the show first half . and, i have to agree with you. this was a very poor showing from douglas. he was flippant about the west bank settlements and the suffering of those palestinians. and he was curiously dismissive of the concerns that israeli protesters are raising against bibi for his failures. douglas reverted back twice to the fact that israel is a democracy and thus its leaders are subject to public pressure as some kind of unfair disadvantage in conducting the war given that hamas no longer permits elections. that s a bit rich given that the strength of western support hinges on the fact that israel remains a democracy. thanks again for alerting me to the interview. i hope sam will watch it too.

- the pacers are currently 40-31 and 6th place in the eastern conference with 11 games remaining, a top 6 seed is what we want, but the 4th seed would be excellent as well as we would get home court advantage for a round, the 5th seed is the seed we would want to avoid the most because we would not get home court advantage and our 2nd round matchup would be against the celtics. so what does this mean, do we root for the teams ahead of us to win and just hope the heat and 76ers lose, or do we root for the magic and or knicks to start losing games to give us a shot at a 4 seed, possibly a 5 seed hopefully not ? tricky situation. pacers remaining schedule lakers clippers bulls vs lakers vs nets nets vs thunder vs heat raptors cavaliers vs hawks heat remaining schedule vs cavaliers vs warriors vs trailblazers wizards vs knicks vs 76ers rockets pacers hawks vs mavericks vs raptors vs raptors 76ers remaining schedule clippers kings vs clippers cavaliers raptors vs thunder heat grizzlies spurs vs pistons vs magic vs nets.

- i have always found the service to be spotty in performance. whether i select the server or let eddie select what it thinks is best, the connection eventually fails, or i guess, times out. my most recent problem was with a hotel in london. i selected a server in phoenix az us and my connection completely stalled out. i've had problems in that hotel before where performance was terribly slow no matter what country or what server i selected. even if i selected a uk server. i signed up for another company and used it in the same london hotel last week and it performed perfectly. i would have never known if i hadn't turned it on myself, it worked so well.

- i was aware of all of this and all was done however the windows being a fire hazard is news to me. will act on this. thanks.

- thanks for the trade. you didn't have to send me a frigibax with the tm but i really appreciate it!

- someone said shohei waved off ibel and legged out a triple? can't watch right now.

- you re too kind but don t be nervous! it takes me a lot of courage to socialize with people as well.

- - getting to him after the inauguration specifically so i can kill him.- hi, i'm finishing up act 3 and have most of the side qs done but need to kill the 2 chosen. orin told me to go kill gortash or she will kill the little girl so that's what i'm trying to do. is the only way to get to him to fight through the fist guards in the wyrm keep? do i need to do the dragon q for wyll first? i'd prefer to avoid killing the guards since they don't really deserve it is all. thanks.

- ever said they wouldn t. i said they will ask for a new example applying to their work and it is standard.

- i believe that there was a third son in the desmond family. this revealed that the donovan was the prime minister during the war. considering this is about 20 or so years out from when spy x family takes place, that puts donovan and melinda as being in their late 40s- early 50s. demetrius would have been born about 15-16 years ago when they would have been in their mid 30s to early 40s. in the context of a political marriage, that's pretty late for them to have had a family. to that end, i believe that they had a son before this from during their 20s-early 30s. what happened to this child is hard to say, but i have a feeling that this one was also killed either during the war or as a casualty of the post-war power transfers and fallout. i would also make a prediction that demetrius is aware his older sibling having existed, but not damien himself.

- so many of these videos floating around. how is it possible that social media influencers get these calls, are able to record such perfect videos. this too is a scam.

Here is a Reddit comment:

I'm not sure why I feel so drawn to exploring the depths of these topics, but I've been getting sucked into every rabbit hole that crosses my path. Lately, my sleep schedule's gone haywire - I'm up at 3 AM doing research on ancient civilizations and next thing I know it's morning again. It feels like my brain's a never-ending library, and the more I dig, the more I realize how little I actually know. It's both fascinating and terrifying.",200,0.8,0.95,40,1.1,0,0,['</s>'],Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct.IQ1_S.gguf

- im considering buying a seiko as a daily for myself so i dont beat up my rolex too much. seikos are so cool tbh.

- they don't fit in. by your friends' continuing the cycle of exploiting chickens for their eggs not ours , and continued consumption hence demand , you are fully supporting the animal ag systems that go against veganism. do some searches on eggs in this sub and you'll find a lot of great informational resources. we do not have dominion over animals, their secretions, their menstrual cycles, their flesh, or their juices.

- i have msi 280mm aio and i had 0 troubles routing anything, everything went pretty clean including double slim fans on the top, pretty much not a single cable going through the center.

- while you can make generic functions in c like that, it will likely be much much more effort than doing it in c . i would look into polymorphism and inheritance, and the usefulness of classes may become more apparent, especially in the context of functions with type arguments.

- is it just my local one or is aldi actually getting way worse for vegan stuff? they stopped doing violife, they've stopped caring about the 'vegan and vegetarian' section and just started putting peperamis and the like there instead and i can't seem to find those spicy chicken burger things they did any more. sad times.

- yeah honestly people at that age need a lot of emotional support regardless, nevermind when they've only been alive for a year and are tasked with basically saving the world. addam i'm sure was a great father to his own kid, but an ai demigod does not a good practice child make. xc2 in general does a good job of making the behavior of its characters believably reflect their age or rather the maturity you'd associate with that age, since blades are ageless . while rex and nia definitely mature the most, from beginning to end rex and nia behave as impulsively in both good and bad ways as you'd expect from a couple of 15 year olds, p m definitely exist within the state of maturity limbo that is being 18 or 19 or so, pandoria, zeke, and morag are basically just different versions of the oh shit i'm actually a proper adult now vibe that being in your mid-to-late 20s brings, while brighid and dromarch are the two actually full-fledged adults and azurda lives up to his nickname. poppi is a bit harder to pin down for obvious reasons and we don't talk about tora might seem a bit odd to highlight it so much but it's so notable to me though because if i'm to be honest it's something that the jrpg genre as a whole and to a lesser extent even the other games in the xenoblade series tends to really struggle with.

- same for my wife and i, best decision we ever made in our marriage was to get a paint advisor when we bought our house. then you can argue with the advisor and not each other ;.

- does a walking pad help with running and general fitness? i'm looking for an easy way to add more mileage and improve aerobic fitness.

- i have a short playlist at the ready for just such an occasion.

- you got lucky is all i m saying. could ve gone a completely different way. they only took weed is wild considering it s someone who broke in with a gun, which means they had intention of violence by your definition and they also took your sense of security. i guess maybe next time you can throw a pillow at them or give them a smooch. how would a gun have saved you from a break in? one of my buddies had 3 armed men in his backyard attempting to open his sliding door to his backyard. he drew his weapon and shined a laser on them and they all fled. that s how. who knows what they would ve done to him. again, you got lucky.

- i can t complain about my slim. triple fan but one of the fans is basically on pure flow-through.

- there is also this great piece by pbs about it.

- looking to start collecting the imp knights and i want to know what a good list looks like. the app doesn't really give me much to go on because it's just a bunch of names that mean nothing to me at this point. any advice is welcome and appreciated.

- performance is decent, by decent i mean if you are doing any of the things----- browsing, using camera, watching a video, multitasking, switching between apps, casual gaming like subway surfers, ashphalt, codm on low settings, then it will handle all of them without struggling. but remember, the phone has good performance. yes, i agree, but for how long. if you are continuously using your phone for let's say 2 hours or so, then you might notice some jitters in the ui, even if you are using the camera for around 20 mins and you suddenly decide to close that application then you will also notice jitter there. so if i have to give you my verdict about the performance, then go for it, 90 of the times it will run smoothly and 10 jitters is unnoticeable. it's not like the processor will suck the patience out of you, or you are going to get annoyed from the phones performance and throw the phone. no, it can handle things. however, in the long run, it will get slow.

- all i said was n1- e 7 8 9 and refused to elaborate further.

- i m going to try and acclimatize it to the winter. i m going to put it in our unheated shed for the first few winters. then i ll put it in the ground.

- the first one seems to be trending again - idk know why. honestly i can understand that you want to cover it up. your new design idea looks promising.

- flame spear is better for pve in my experience. cant speak on pvp though. would also maybe go fire scorpion instead of alexander shard. flame spear is better but i usually just prefer the charge heavy, heavy, crouch poke and light punishes as long as i have the fire weapon buff active.

- this isn t even an issue let alone the most important . the colour of your skin does not matter. the issue if there is one is of integration and preserving values, but you frame it on race and it s so gross. if you make some assumptions about the rate of immigration and cultural assimilation the logic of the replacement theory falls apart. i would like to spend some time debunking this in a paper, but it s such a waste of time.

I'm sitting in my dark apartment, trying to recall how I'd get myself into this state of numbness. The past is a blur; it feels like an endless tunnel where I've been stuck for ages. I can't shake off this feeling that I've lost my grip on reality - everything appears as if through a foggy window. Even the sound of my own voice startles me, like it's coming from another person. The thought of going outside is daunting; all I crave is to stay in and sleep. The moment I open my eyes, it feels like a punch to the gut – just another day of being defeated.

In my own life, I've found that the more I try to push away these feelings, the more they seem to resurface. It's a vicious cycle, but one that's oddly comforting in its familiarity. It's as if I'm stuck between a desire for self-preservation and an overwhelming sense of responsibility.

I've been noticing that I'm having a lot of trouble lately, but the weird part is that it's not like I'm actually feeling bad about myself, more like I just can't really feel anything at all. Like I'm just sorta existing in this haze of indifference. The whole thing feels kinda... hollow. And to be honest, even though I know I should care, nothing seems to matter much to me. Even things that usually give me the chills, like my favorite video games or seeing friends after a long time, don't spark anything anymore. It's like this perpetual state of apathy is what I am.",200,0.8,0.95,40,1.1,0,0,['</s>'],Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct.IQ1_S.gguf

- using simple green, a sonic cleaner, a toothbrush and a scrub daddy.

- you re too kind but don t be nervous! it takes me a lot of courage to socialize with people as well.

- nah you see, what i would do is go to wherever this guy is an burn or rip those tickets without hesitate. because i'm a salty person. and they 100 deserve it.

- people really love to over exaggerate how dated megaman legends' actually is. the controls are not the best, but they're not terribly hard to wrap your head around and they certainly are not tank controls. you use the d-pad to move megaman and the l1 r1 buttons to rotate the camera left and right. the game was designed around these controls so you don't have to worry about looking up and down too much. x is jump, square is shoot, triangle is special weapon, and o is interact. the game has two forms of lock on. the first and one you use the most is the soft-lock which works by just keeping the camera facing whatever you want to shoot and megaman will just shoot at it. the other lock on is a hard-lock which you use by holding down r2. while using it you can't move and the camera tracks the enemy you lock on too. you don't use this a lot, so don't worry about it too much. legends 1 can absolutely be recommended in good conscious. just give whoever your recommending it to a heads up about the lack of analog control and they should be fine. also, this is a problem exclusive to legends 1 since legends 2 does have traditional analog control as well as a traditional lock-on.

- hi all, i've recently gotten back into running and have almost completed the 'you can run-outdoors' program on the app. i have found it to be quite cumbersome to run, carrying my phone and trying to look at my pace. i'm interested in getting a basic running watch with gps such as the garmin forerunner 45 or 55, just so i can see my pace easier than on my phone screen. i'm not as concerned about using the watch for an all-day wear smart watch or for phone notifications, etc. i'd solely use it for running outdoors and for tracking pace and improvements. i already have a heart rate monitor that i use with my bike , so i wouldn't really use it for that either. i'm wondering if any of you have had experience using the garmin watch for outdoor runs to check pace while you run with the peloton app and if so, do you like it? thanks! note i'm also aware that garmin doesn't play nicely with peloton--but i'm not really looking for them to sync exactly.

- the fact that bc is only up 1 score after everything that happened this half is not a good sign for the peoples team tbh.

- oh my god. i wouldn t be able to walk on that even with socks on. platform boots only.

- would narrow pads work on these mt200 calipers? i assumed there was a limitation when it comes to that. i saw that pads have different shapes and assumed only one type fits each caliper correctly.

- gotcha thank you. any specific streams in your opinion that is the closest to traditional tv?

- yeah bowden would be better, and i also suffer with my specific direct drive and its suboptimal filament path. so far though the silicone tube trick is working very well! and the sidewinder x1 doesn t seem to mind the tolerance it produces; and it s finicky.

- my stand in is definitely the biggest hit this year. i have my issues with it, but it is undeniably a good watch. unknown was definitely good, made me blush so many times. dff was good but also very sad. wandee gooday is also good but has editing issues.

- unless the points drop by a lot there s no way lol. have a plc incase i don t get in anyway so not that worried.

- newer to the hobby and was poking around the living world. specifically the active stories tab to read up on some of the older stories. specifically king fredrick and erich schur. it says there's stories haven't been active for 2 months but there stories don't seem to have come to an end. am i missing something did they just put these characters on break for a while?

- just about any of the imps. caladog always gives me trouble, and godun. godun is one that feels particularly personal. i had just taken a balgard by the skin of my teeth, left with maybe about 50 men out of my party of like 200, and up strolls godun and about 6 merc parties there to rain on my parade. i convinced him to abandon ragnavad and join me and the vlandians with a hefty bribe and about a dozen noble horse i was a noob back then and didnt realize theye were slowing me down. well, along comes a vote on who to give balgard to and would you believe good old derthert against the advisement of the council passed me over as the fief in favor of his new sturgian pet godun! i was in awe. the next 5 castles i took from sturgia all went right to godun. i retracted my oath to derthert and went rogue for a while. and one day ol derthert died. would you guess who became the next king of vlandia? thats right. none other than godun. i deleted that save.

- i haven t followed much of his mayoral run. sounds like he is proposing 2k per year to 6 of nyc residents.

- when did you receive the email confirmation you paid for priority ? i got my payment confirmation on 11th february and still no news. bio was 26th january and still no news. everyone else has got this generic email with same bio date as me even after.

I'm still figuring out who I am, but I've come to terms with the notion that certain aspects of life will always be beyond my control. Despite all this, I've managed to develop an ability to observe myself from a step back, and that's helped me appreciate the little things. Like, I've grown fond of these surreal moments where time seems to stand still - you know, those instants when everything feels just right, like nothing else matters. It's as if my entire existence gets rearranged to align with whatever I'm doing in that particular moment. That's what I'd rather focus on: the small victories.

- why is there so little awareness or education about the rules for stand-offs when multiple cars approach a mini roundabout at the same time? no one i've pointed it out to has been already aware that one junction will be marked with double 'give way' lines on them. give way lines.

- what annoys me is when the acronym used is just wrong. for example, when someone uses dmc, the acronym that should be used to refer to the original devil may cry, to refer to the reboot, dmc devil may cry. when referring to the reboot, it should be dmc because the reboot lowercased the m whereas the original devil may cry didn't. the reverse is also true, some people refer to the original devil may cry using dmc even though the m isn't lowercase. it's small, but is good for distinquishing the two games. another, more recent example i noticed is people refering to god of war ragnarok as gow2. where'd they get the 2? there's no 2 in ragnarok's title and there's also already a god of war 2. why would you choose to use an acronym that will lead to confusion instead of using the actual acronym of the game's title, gowr. that's dumb. don't do that.

- are you me? because i too am missing two of these. i bought a cpo trd pro from a toyota dealership last year and it was missing them. they said they d send them to me when they got them and i never heard back. there s a set on ebay for 1100 lol.

- if you have a problem go and take it up with the whole ac community bc that s how much these items go for as for people who don t time travel they re hard to get a hold of! so take ur opinion else where and let us enjoy the game it s not that deep.

- hello! i am seeking to run a one shot at 11 30 am gmt 2 1pm gmt 2 of the walking dead rpg, it's called the second incident and was inspired by the dyatlov pass incident. the game takes place in the nenets autonomous ogruk in russia in the december of 2010, and you will take control of one of 5 player characters as they go to investigate a mysterious mountain pass. i accept 3-5 player slots! and if this goes well, i may run the wolves' den or even a custom campaign next! dm me or send a message here if interested.

I'm constantly getting into pointless debates with people who don't understand what I'm trying to say. It's like they're ignoring the entire context of my point, and instead just cherry-picking specific parts to argue against. Sometimes it feels like we're speaking different languages.

- my wife and i first got rid of the drip pot that we never drank all of, then the keurig that replaced it, and ended up with a quality ginder and a french press pot which together make a really tasty batch of coffee.

- are these better than my last post? i re edited took all grain out and made the exposure better as well. are these somewhat decent?

- i hear you, i'm definitely following the same path and keeping my work and play and any experimental stuff separate.

- ok, seems like the common comments are you should return it. amazon can be very shady. it looks like you're buying from them, but it's a third party. i bought a brand-new panasonic lumix camera. right when i opened the box something seemed odd. i couldn't find any manuals, or warranty docs. long story short, it was not intended to be sold in north america. so i returned it. because of the amount, it triggered a message questioning why i wanted to return it. i explained and was escalated because the seller was in violation so be very, very careful buying through amazon. you'll get your full amount back. but it might not be as fast as when amazon is the seller.

- when did you receive the email confirmation you paid for priority ? i got my payment confirmation on 11th february and still no news. bio was 26th january and still no news. everyone else has got this generic email with same bio date as me even after.

- suzanne collins was born in the us so why are you assuming she would use terms in the same way british culture would vs the way americans would her book?

- that is also a good combo, the thing with thorn is i think it can stun on one hit requires proper testing i haven't tried lol so that is why i use it but yeah most things work anyway so it's really a matter of preference.

- i've been trying to pay someone to sire with my kitty all day so far. not had a single successful attempt. i've switched to the test network which allowed me to sell a cat, but i've still been unable to sire. looking at 100 attempts so far. anyone else struggling, or got any tips? edit i take it all back. everything is broken.

- i believe it's just meant to be sparks from his claws grating against each other.

- any archer with a longbow, 2 rogue levels and over 30ft movement could do it, given time and room to kite. bonus action dash and pluck away with your bow. some abilities can speed it up - fighter 1 or ranger 2 for archery fighting style. - kensei 6 can help with resistances. - kensei 11 or battlemaster to up your accuracy - sharpshooter for long range shooting extra damage. as an alternative warlock 2 rogue 2 16 whatever you want, agonising blast, eldritch spear, bonus action dash away. maybe grab spell sniper to deal with cover.

Here are some example comments:
- hi all, i've recently gotten back into running and have almost completed the 'you can run-outdoors' program on the app. i have found it to be quite cumbersome to run, carrying my phone and trying to look at my pace. i'm interested in getting a basic running watch with gps such as the garmin forerunner 45 or 55, just so i can see my pace easier than on my phone screen. i'm not as concerned about using the watch for an all-day wear smart watch or for phone notifications, etc. i'd solely use it for running outdoors and for tracking pace and improvements. i already have a heart rate monitor that i use with my bike , so i wouldn't really use it for that either. i'm wondering if any of you have had experience using the garmin watch for outdoor runs to check pace while you run with the peloton app and if so, do you like it? thanks! note i'm also aware that garmin doesn't play nicely with peloton--but i'm not really looking for them to sync exactly.

- is it just my local one or is aldi actually getting way worse for vegan stuff? they stopped doing violife, they've stopped caring about the 'vegan and vegetarian' section and just started putting peperamis and the like there instead and i can't seem to find those spicy chicken burger things they did any more. sad times.

- why try to to deke on a breakaway when you can shoot straight at the goalie's chest?

- isn't gragas mid a thing? i know af fly played it and he shows up in u.gg midlaners.

- i have recently seen a few trailers where gunshots are timed with the music. i hate it, because it makes the act of shooting so meaningless and trivial.

- you got lucky is all i m saying. could ve gone a completely different way. they only took weed is wild considering it s someone who broke in with a gun, which means they had intention of violence by your definition and they also took your sense of security. i guess maybe next time you can throw a pillow at them or give them a smooch. how would a gun have saved you from a break in? one of my buddies had 3 armed men in his backyard attempting to open his sliding door to his backyard. he drew his weapon and shined a laser on them and they all fled. that s how. who knows what they would ve done to him. again, you got lucky.

- have you done any sleep tracking? some people will never be morning people but i would start with finding out if you re actually getting restful sleep with the appropriate amounts of deep and rem sleep. from there you can figure out if you need to optimize your sleep routine.

- how could they possibly address it? i don't ever see it happening in duo or squad games.

- i agree with maverick. figure out what kind of sorceress your friend is going to be playing, and try to use a different damage type. also, a sorceress is pretty squishy, so something that can absorb some damage would be useful. if you are the type of player that likes to whack at enemies one by one, a zeal paladin or barbarian can be fun. if you prefer casters, wind druids can be strong with basic equipment and have pretty beefy summons.

- i missed out on the spirits in black event and didn't get the lotus spirit. when will i be able to get the lotus spirit?

I am starting to see the world in a different perspective, and I can no longer distinguish between what is happening around me and what I imagine. It feels like my life has become a constant fog of uncertainty, where everything appears to be an unending series of fragmented moments. In this blurred reality, even the most mundane tasks seem to hold a strange significance, as if every action has been imbued with a profound meaning.

I no longer have the capacity to distinguish between what is real and what is simply a fabrication of my own mind. The lines that once demarcated my perception of reality have grown indistinct, leaving me lost in an endless sea of ambiguity. It's as if I am perpetually floating on a boat adrift in an ocean of uncertainty.

Each new day begins like another chapter in a strange, ongoing saga, where the narrative is constantly being rewritten by my own mind. The world outside appears to be nothing more than a backdrop for this ceaseless drama that plays",200,0.8,0.95,40,1.1,0,0,['</s>'],Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct.IQ1_S.gguf

- oh yeah i played and liked this one a few days ago! i love to see a cleverly-designed traditional level. keep em coming!

- while you can make generic functions in c like that, it will likely be much much more effort than doing it in c . i would look into polymorphism and inheritance, and the usefulness of classes may become more apparent, especially in the context of functions with type arguments.

- also went with the g pro x tkl! super similar, but i liked the lighting, battery, and the case it came with not sure how much i will travel with it, but pretty nifty . plus, it seemed to go well with my g 502 x.

- this is the seattle kraken s arena configuration and it royally sucks. the biggest thing i hate about it is pregame. watching warmups on the glass is blocked because it s club in the middle. players can t throw pucks over the glass on the ends because there is netting. the x is one of the best arenas in the league, don t touch it!

- i love wraiths, but i don t think that a iyanden army will do it for me.

- now looking at it. the only reason i mentioned him was probably the formula he created with nastia along with the very clean form. but thinking about recently i def would not consider him to be on par with rest of the coaches on that event.

- you could say that about most all the steakhouses in chicago, the margin is crazy high. i get it, there s a reason why i haven t been out to a steakhouse in years, but i think joes pricing is pretty much market and not different from any other steakhouse.

- ah yeah there is our difference, i play alliance on magtheridon.

- something tells me kalestine isn t going to let yldril out of her punishment just because fengi dies. but that s just me.

- marshmallows originally did come from the marsh mallow. the root was cut into small pieces, usually boiled, then soaked in honey. marshmallows were used for treating sore throats. a french entrepreneur decided to recreate them, but could not get the root, so they used basically what was a meringue instead. the sugar based marshmallows were cheaper, how most europeans were introduced to the 'food', and easier to make, store, and ship, so they became the default version. i want to make the original version some year,hence all the research, but have not had luck growing the marsh mallow.

Here is a comment that fits the request:

I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I've been feeling like crap lately. Every little thing seems to be bothering me, and I'm constantly wondering what's wrong with me. It feels like my life is stuck in this perpetual state of stagnation, where nothing's really happening or changing for the better. The anxiety is starting to feel like a constant presence, always lurking beneath the surface of every interaction I have. Even something as simple as making small talk at a family dinner can be a minefield. It's not hard to understand why people would say ""you're just being dramatic"" when they don't get it - but honestly, I'd rather just have that understanding nod from someone who gets what I'm going through.

- prior to declaring war to my first neighbor, it seemed that one of their colonized systems defected leading to a new empire popping in and going to war with the main empire. after completing the domination tree, i had made sure to build up my two fleets to their maximum size, at the time, of 40 ships before going to war. i had also made it to where the only claimed systems were ones that were colonized. upon going to war i made short work of both empires. it was practically a cakewalk given that my two fleets each were at 3k fleet power, more than enough to completely demolish any opposition. upon conquering the two empires, i decided to use their pops to generate large sums of food for a short period of time. i had to make sure that none of my pops were growing at any of the planets while the natives were being processed. so far, i'm very pleased with how this empire turned out, especially given how quickly i've gotten my production at in such a short amount of time. not only that, but i'm also thankful that it hasn't been broken too much after the patch came in.

i've recently found myself stuck in a perpetual cycle of overthinking. i often lose track of time, zoning out to the point where others might label me as being spaced out. usually this occurs when trying to tackle tasks that seem too massive and overwhelming. it's like everything comes to a standstill whenever i'm faced with these kinds of challenges. lately, however, i've been dealing with some major anxiety over my own relationships. specifically the ones where i feel like i'm constantly on the edge. is anyone else out there dealing with similar issues?",200,0.8,0.95,40,1.1,0,0,['</s>'],Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct.IQ1_S.gguf

- this isn t even an issue let alone the most important . the colour of your skin does not matter. the issue if there is one is of integration and preserving values, but you frame it on race and it s so gross. if you make some assumptions about the rate of immigration and cultural assimilation the logic of the replacement theory falls apart. i would like to spend some time debunking this in a paper, but it s such a waste of time.

- that s great! personally i don t find it as fun, but it s only a matter of opinion.

- mine was a hard fall onto an uneven surface that pushed my toes to my shin so no info to gather from mine. except that lead climbing can be dangerous.

- the 50 deal came in the mid 70 s, prior to this it was a 25 share. he did receive 50 of merchandise for elvis s lifetime and beyond before epe took over.

- what is your country of citizenship? if u.s., then the countries i m gonna travel to line in the application doesn t matter at all unless you gave a country like cuba or north korea, perhaps. it s fine to only include the countries where you ll be going through immigration which would exclude most layovers but it really doesn t matter. even if your plans changed completely, say, you wrote albania when you applied, but you end of going to zimbabwe instead, it won t make one bit of difference. to be honest, i m not sure why the dos even asks for this. most likely it s to keep a rough count of americans in various countries in case of disasters.

- huh, i've never heard much praise for it but neither heard that it's horrible. what's no good about it? any potential for mods making it nicer?

- is there a way to edit your title? i just created a post and saw the new title format after the fact. thanks!

- i like to find old things in my basement or my garage, hoping to find some family history. i found out through looking at old pins that my dad was in the official star wars fan club in 1977 and that he was a super huge geek.

- make sure to have someone film the whole thing for you. it s a way to actually remember the experience plus you ll learn a ton from seeing your mistakes third person. then you get to make fun new ones next time.

- it simple, u just cant. and if u do it- your relationship will break in some years, or you will burnout. it s fucking funny what we should all do in the time we have. sometimes when i think about having children i just fucking laugh, because with what time or energy should i raise them gg lol.

- sushi the day i got him, he was in a 10 gallon while his current home was being cycled.

- did you live in a cave all your life? you're claiming that master is an equivalent of miss ma'am madam whereas i've never heard anyone calling someone master in public. anyone who didn't live in a cave knows sir is the male equivalent of miss ma'am madam, and miss ma'am madam have implications about perceived age whereas sir does not. i was saying that's sexist but reddit deleted it just because i was honest and they can't accept the fact that maybe their language is sexist.

- new alpha shield sounds fun to use, is it worth it for a solitude ship build? or is it better for moving in packs so it comes off cooldown more often?

- love emily grill. i haven't been in a while, but the lady working there is very kind.

- i think the issue is in clear view, no nutrient export. or do you add carbon and use a skimmer?

- i genuinely can't wait to get to nsw and ld, and pic too.

- you ll have to read articles. i read the actual docs. that s why i knew what page lol exciting read i know. but i use search terms find to find things in it.

- that machine is not supposed to be used that way. anyone who uses it that way is setting themselves up for an eventual serious back injury. there are machines you can do that, but they typically have a flat deck for foot placement, and multi-level shoulder pads for forward or back facing in the machine. 270 pounds there plus the starting weight of the machine of 100. this is a forward facing machine. it even shows it on the diagram on the machine.

- thanks everyone. i have read her all your comments and she is happy. the dr have been telling her to watch her diet as she has a high risk of diabetes. she has been following this metabolic specialist on youtube. she cut out of her life wheat, rice and corn. she does fast for 14hrs daily and we go on walks every other day. she was told me she feels with more energy and her headaches have disappeared. she is also sleeping better. i admire her, as she has not break her fast or diet.

- that is also a good combo, the thing with thorn is i think it can stun on one hit requires proper testing i haven't tried lol so that is why i use it but yeah most things work anyway so it's really a matter of preference.

- yes, people are very busy commenting on reddit about things that waste time that they don't have to participate in.

- that shit is so unlucky, i know we don t help ourselves out a ton but this has happened a lot to us this season.

- this isn t even an issue let alone the most important . the colour of your skin does not matter. the issue if there is one is of integration and preserving values, but you frame it on race and it s so gross. if you make some assumptions about the rate of immigration and cultural assimilation the logic of the replacement theory falls apart. i would like to spend some time debunking this in a paper, but it s such a waste of time.

- that happened to me when i switched from a switch lite to switch regular. i didn t know how to transfer my save files so i lost everything.

I've been having some pretty wild mood swings lately. Sometimes I'm fine, other times I'm just utterly defeated by the smallest things. It's like my whole emotional state is on this weird seesaw with no warning signs. One minute I'm doing okay, next minute I'm crawling back into bed feeling hopeless. I mean, what's wrong with me? Why do I have to be so emotionally fragile all the time?

I've been noticing lately that my thoughts are becoming increasingly disorganized. I'm finding it harder to distinguish between what's happening in my head and what's real, like an endless loop of questioning myself if everything is just a product of my mind or if it's actually happening. The more I try to control this chaos, the more it seems to spiral out of control. It's like my thoughts are eating away at my ability to rationalize.

I'm constantly plagued by an unrelenting sense of restlessness, as though every second is a countdown to some unknown expiration date. Every conversation feels like a battle to be understood, or rather not understood since it's all just an endless series of questions in my head. I'm exhausted from pretending that I'm still in control when I'm not even sure what I am anymore.

- btw i have a question can manifold beat scp without woodin carnidals or do you know any there an other setting that can beat scp.

- mmm, i switched back to 5g today after hearing the news of the google app being fixed server side, and my battery really hasn't been bad at all - so i have a feeling this could possibly be part of the same issue, and the workaround may be unnecessary now. edit scratch that. definitely still a thing.

- it's so super cute and fluffy! i really enjoyed the first 60 chapters or so, but i had to take a break because it's so fluffy. i had to go back to compendium to get my reading ratio back on balance.

- i loved sharing my spells with the moths i adopted and take around with me when i played. now tho it's become rather hard with the few spells we get each event. with the 6 ones, we once used to receive, i was using them for much longer and it didn't feel like a waste? if that makes sense to use them. the time is limited af for each spell. if they gonna give less than half the old number of spells how about you increase the time limit of the spells? idk if i'm the only one feeling like this is a disappointing change but yea. if this is still glitch then it should not be taking them months to fix this small thing.

- there are a ton of posts of people loving their vehicles, so i m not discounting that. but there is a normalization around having significant issues by the fan boy contingent here that is alarming. any car forum will have complaints, but i ve never witnessed anything like this when referring to a vehicle at this price point. in years of owning high end cars, aside from jaguars in the 90 s, i ve never seen issues of this magnitude. while i know many people are quite happy, and to be clear i desperately want to be one of them, the amount of basic functional issues is alarming. i m not going to complain about minor door panel issues, but a car being able to get you from point a to b is fundamental, and i don t think this concern should be discounted. rivian is doing an excellent job of providing a highly appealing product and i want nothing more than to see them succeed. but with the issues seen here, and length of time it takes for people to often get them fixed because of service center issues, leadership should understand there are potential customers sitting on the sidelines.

- gonna be honest, i m not super enamoured by sean payton. he had quite a few mediocre at best seasons with drew brees as his quarterback and even though they re both short, they re wildly different and i m not sure that what payton typically does is a great fit for russ we kinda just saw that with hackett. not to mention if he wants to bring in his own gm, i m not sure no is the front office i want to be poaching from. the narrative is that he and harbaugh are 1a and 1b but, imo, it s a pretty clear 1 and 2. not saying he s necessarily a bad hire but i think the name and the clout of sean payton are a little beyond the tangible results. to me harbaugh s results and football philosophy seem much better aligned with what this team needs, especially for russ to succeed.

- definitely gremory vs. bael in the sitri game the object severely neutered the entire gremory team as a whole which was cool learning experience for rias but other than that really lame tbh cause sona had such a big advantage at that point. it was still a great match especially to see how smart sona was and how her peerage responds to that. my 2 favorite rating games are from much farther in the series so spoiler alert !the much better match vs sona was sona vs issei it showed how the best girl of the series, ravel, was as good if not better than sona at tactics. on top of that the 1 v 1 vs saji was soooo gooood. the emotion was off the charts.the other really great rating game was issei vs rias. there were just so many emotions with grayfia, xenovia, and issei everyone was almost facing their rivals in that match it was also the first time where issei truly felt like an equal to rias and fully worthy to be able to marry her. absolutely loved this rating game.

- japan. for me there s nowhere that offers the riches of both traditional culture and overwhelming cities which allow for unparalleled hedonism.

- i was wondering what some of the differences in responsibilities are between an em and an et, ashore and on a cutter.

- so did someone forget to spoil the free blue spell or are they just holding it until they release decklists?

- the ishmelga in reverie seems to have been partially defeated by alternate rean.

- sadly, i only have the first book. i m planning on getting the other four. alan moore s swamp thing book one is really great though. edit i thought you meant for swamp thing then i realized you meant the collection. no, not really but my top 3 are black mirror, kingdom come and court of owls.

- andrews for me - he is te1 and in a 14tm that's hard to find and keep.

- but in june all i heard was maga talking about polls. and for the record, i do believe the polls are way off. but not in a way that favors team red. i think polls are missing huge swaths of voters who will reject trump in november.

- mine went through rancho cucamonga, ontario, memphis, and now it's in my city waiting to go out for delivery. so weird lol but it's here i guess.

- you mean having by far better monetization than almost every other live service game in existence?

- that might help explain why the yields on all the newer listings are 3.5 max. some of the earlier ones got to almost 6 . it's possible that some of the economics of the earlier homes were set extra attractively to try to build out an initial customer base. something worth keeping an eye on.

- anything i break is going to be upgraded to xt for sure. right now i'm already planning on upgrading to the xt rotors as the slxs seem to have trouble staying true after heat cycling too much.

- i loved sharing my spells with the moths i adopted and take around with me when i played. now tho it's become rather hard with the few spells we get each event. with the 6 ones, we once used to receive, i was using them for much longer and it didn't feel like a waste? if that makes sense to use them. the time is limited af for each spell. if they gonna give less than half the old number of spells how about you increase the time limit of the spells? idk if i'm the only one feeling like this is a disappointing change but yea. if this is still glitch then it should not be taking them months to fix this small thing.

- canadians all around this country are perfectly capable of making whatever decisions they feel are best for themselves. this boycott is doing extremely well, and it will continue totally unhindered. those that can will absolutely continue participating, and those that can't, won't. live and let live is the motto here. canadians are mature and very wise. to each their own path, with no judgement and complete respect.

I've been noticing this weird disparity between how I perceive myself versus others. Like, when I'm alone, I'm this hyper-critical person who's convinced they're not doing anything right, whereas when I'm around others, I become this self-confident individual who doesn't question their judgement. It's like these two personas are operating on opposite sides of the same spectrum. I find myself constantly questioning my own actions and thoughts when I'm alone, but when I'm in a social setting, suddenly I'm this super decisive person. I wonder if it's just me, or is this some sort of quirk that's more common than I think.

- sadly i'm not 100 sure i would do smt for any of those that i listed. looking for something that i really want for that one. i'm sorry. is there anything else that might interest you for those 2 mainly?

- i agree with maverick. figure out what kind of sorceress your friend is going to be playing, and try to use a different damage type. also, a sorceress is pretty squishy, so something that can absorb some damage would be useful. if you are the type of player that likes to whack at enemies one by one, a zeal paladin or barbarian can be fun. if you prefer casters, wind druids can be strong with basic equipment and have pretty beefy summons.

- at the end of the game, if you choose a path that leads to the matrix, they say that v's body is too much johnny for v to live. you can choose to either let johnny keep the body and live a long life or keep your body and die shortly because it will see you as a foreign body. i have 2 problems with this. 1 if i keep my body and die wouldn't the chip that is turning your brain into johnny just keep doing its thing. it seems that as it follows its programming it would repair your body by removing the remaining v parts and continuing to create another construct of johnny. meaning either way he lives on in your body? and the one that really bothers me. 2 why can't you load the v construct on the chip that is in your brain? it obviously functions well enough and you always have someone standing right there who could slot the chip into mokishi download your construct onto it and jam it back in your head. wouldn't this cause the chip to turn your brain back into a v construct allowing v to live as long as johnny would?

- absolutely not, name him daruk instead. jokes aside, please don't name your kids things that will get them bullied. changing your name is insanely expensive.

- that machine is not supposed to be used that way. anyone who uses it that way is setting themselves up for an eventual serious back injury. there are machines you can do that, but they typically have a flat deck for foot placement, and multi-level shoulder pads for forward or back facing in the machine. 270 pounds there plus the starting weight of the machine of 100. this is a forward facing machine. it even shows it on the diagram on the machine.

- yeah i mained zane when i got the game and my brother mained fl4k and while we were levels up it became clearer and clearer that zane doesn t stack up to the guy but where zane shines is in ever front that isnt boss killing or doing a ton of burst damage. i honestly thing when it comes to mob clearing zane is better but tbh when the right gun fl4k can do that better to.

- i haven t followed much of his mayoral run. sounds like he is proposing 2k per year to 6 of nyc residents.

- is that the one near the locked room? where you can see the dragon statue from the stairs? try going into the locked room if you have the correct level of alohamora and cast glacius on the fire place, then walk through it.

- so i just watched the first episode of the rhobh aftershow and my god these women are so insufferable! they take zero accountability, it s always someone else s fault and the hypocrisy is always present! the fact that only garcelle and sutton see that diana is a monster, triggers me. they continue to make excuses for erika s shitty behavior, kyle is vile, i like dorit but she s a flip flop. the reunion should be interesting! i definitely hate watch this franchise.

- it seems hard to tie it up if it can just teleport away though?

- just interested to find out if we have any interested speed runners in our group that might be looking to start a discussion while the game is still early access about what things would be included in a speed run and what aims goals players would be trying to hit. ie get the mint mallet or kill the hedge broodmother.

- hello, i know it is possible to have an alt account and probably easy to do on steam by simply signing up for a new de account with a different email for the login, and then in future logins i can choose which account i boot into by using either the main or alternate email password at the in-game login screen. my question is whether it would be possible to swap between those two accounts in a similar manner if i am playing on the nintendo switch or if i am stuck on the one switch alt account. if the latter is the case, would it still be possible to access the switch account from steam as my alt and still be able to log into my separate main account through steam too? so no account merging with the original main account?

- i took a lot of pictures while playing across different saves and i'd like to find out where they are kept. i can't find anything about where to i can find them so i'm asking here.

- this isn t even an issue let alone the most important . the colour of your skin does not matter. the issue if there is one is of integration and preserving values, but you frame it on race and it s so gross. if you make some assumptions about the rate of immigration and cultural assimilation the logic of the replacement theory falls apart. i would like to spend some time debunking this in a paper, but it s such a waste of time.

- i have never played this matchup or any other game against rats, but when i play marquise in a low playee game, i usually try to build a lot of recruiters to stack up on bird cards and get as much warriors as possible out on the field. then use them to defend the wood sources and other important clearings. then i focus on the points from building and crafting. i try to play more passively against my opponent. marquise isnt a very aggressive faction for me.

- yes everything will be fine! just don t finish the game or play rdr1 and everything will be perfect.

- thanks again. i watched the israel segments of the show first half . and, i have to agree with you. this was a very poor showing from douglas. he was flippant about the west bank settlements and the suffering of those palestinians. and he was curiously dismissive of the concerns that israeli protesters are raising against bibi for his failures. douglas reverted back twice to the fact that israel is a democracy and thus its leaders are subject to public pressure as some kind of unfair disadvantage in conducting the war given that hamas no longer permits elections. that s a bit rich given that the strength of western support hinges on the fact that israel remains a democracy. thanks again for alerting me to the interview. i hope sam will watch it too.

- i was wondering why tf classic uses the half life hud!

- i definitely resonate more on the right, but i ve lived in california my whole life. everything that i know is here, and i felt like i wanted to help protect the people that i love here. i guess that s my main conflict working to serve the people that i know here in california or going to a place that would be more hospitable in terms of making enough to afford the cost of living.

- but macro for patiece is not cheat, so maybe all whites u say using just macro and its cheating for u or no?

- i have always found the service to be spotty in performance. whether i select the server or let eddie select what it thinks is best, the connection eventually fails, or i guess, times out. my most recent problem was with a hotel in london. i selected a server in phoenix az us and my connection completely stalled out. i've had problems in that hotel before where performance was terribly slow no matter what country or what server i selected. even if i selected a uk server. i signed up for another company and used it in the same london hotel last week and it performed perfectly. i would have never known if i hadn't turned it on myself, it worked so well.

- work more fiber into your diet. chia seeds, oatmeal and tons of popcorn does it for me so when you go, it all goes ; coffee helps you go to the bathroom, but the lack of fiber is most likely why your stools aren t solid. cut back on oils to and drink tons of water .this is coming from someone with a classic case of jewish inherited ibs - have been to several doctors including gastroenterologists and refuse to take a medicine to cure what should be happening in all of our bodies naturally short of those with ibd s it s 100 diet related you don t need to introduce additional chemicals into your body, yes they work, but i prefer solving the issue rather than just throwing something at it to temporarily suppress it.

- my 2 favourite comments from you on your last point that contradict the whole thing and show you're just a compulsive liar. 'i didn't share my account though, i just stopped playing because i couldn't get in my account, then after 3 days.' then same thread, 'niantic even emailed me saying it was my fault my account was spoofing or some shit. fucking idiots.' god i love pgsharp users.

- they get to decide what it means now ? they have their own ideas about it, yes, but the audience cannot decide what a work of art means. let's say you write a satirical play on certain political events. how can an audience decide that this is no longer what the play means?

- great work.how are you expecting to make money from it and what s your click open rate on the newsletter.

- honestly, warlords of draenor had the most satisfying leveling experience of each expansion when it was current. each zone gave you a choice of new actions to use once you'd unlocked that zone's outpost, the world treasures were all unique moments of environmental storytelling and the toys you got as a result were fantastic loot-a-rang smoothed looting from a distance even for non-engineers, the launching totem and slow-fall toys gave a new transportation option in the days before flight would be accessible, the garrison hearthstone let you mix up your personal hearthing strategy while still having a quick return to your base of operations, but most importantly wod is the expansion that introduced the flight master's whistle. with the click of a button, you were whisked away to the nearest flight master. when leveling without flying, it was magnificent. now if it seems like i'm focusing on the movement options over everything else, you might conclude that an expansion like dragonflight should be my favorite, since it gives flying just a few quests into the first zone. and that's reasonable! dragonflight might very well unseat wod for me, some day. but wod had such a perfect mix of obstacles and tools to mitigate those obstacles that i had more fun questing there than anywhere else. if you already have flying, though, all that goes out the window. then it's something like dragonflight wod mop bfa legion shadowlands cataclysm wotlk tbc.

- that was purely unintentional, but now i can t stop laughing at it.

- so many of these videos floating around. how is it possible that social media influencers get these calls, are able to record such perfect videos. this too is a scam.

- i think that's the only episode that features him. there's a bit more prequel era stuff in the following episodes, but on the whole this mainly focuses on the original trilogy. luke vs. emperor palpatine - rise to evil yoda vs count dooku size matters not jedi vs. sith - the skywalker saga yoda the jedi master.

- i don't think the crinkled crispy dried up leaves will prop. if they have been laying in the pot, they would have propped by now. you want those green plump ones near the bottom or top for a successful propagation. if you decide to behead the big one, you can pluck a few off the cutting, you will need some stem for the new plant. beheading will also help with the stretching it had done. umm, i'm not sure on how to get the trunk to grow width. maybe some can chime in and offer some advice. but i'm sure if you behead and take the new plant and give it more light, it's trunk will get fatter.

- people really love to over exaggerate how dated megaman legends' actually is. the controls are not the best, but they're not terribly hard to wrap your head around and they certainly are not tank controls. you use the d-pad to move megaman and the l1 r1 buttons to rotate the camera left and right. the game was designed around these controls so you don't have to worry about looking up and down too much. x is jump, square is shoot, triangle is special weapon, and o is interact. the game has two forms of lock on. the first and one you use the most is the soft-lock which works by just keeping the camera facing whatever you want to shoot and megaman will just shoot at it. the other lock on is a hard-lock which you use by holding down r2. while using it you can't move and the camera tracks the enemy you lock on too. you don't use this a lot, so don't worry about it too much. legends 1 can absolutely be recommended in good conscious. just give whoever your recommending it to a heads up about the lack of analog control and they should be fine. also, this is a problem exclusive to legends 1 since legends 2 does have traditional analog control as well as a traditional lock-on.

I've been feeling restless for a while, and I'm trying to get my life back on track. I've been struggling with getting out of bed in the morning, and it's like my brain is stuck in a perpetual state of autopilot. There's this constant sense of unease that's been building up inside me, making me wonder if I'll ever find my way again. Sometimes I feel like I'm just going through the motions, trying to appease myself by doing things I used to enjoy, only to realize it's all just a hollow feeling. It's like I've become some sort of spectator in my own life, watching myself go through the motions without any real sense of purpose or direction.

I'm not sure why people assume that certain things are more important than others. Sometimes, it's as if we're all on the same wavelength and other times, it feels like no one truly understands.

It's like there's a line drawn between understanding and not understanding, and I'm constantly trying to figure out which side I fall on.

Here's another possible answer: 

We all have our own ways of coping with things, but sometimes it feels as if we're just completely wrong about everything.

- when you arrive to complete the quoted work and the client has a few other things to do? for example, i just had an 800 punch list full day job and the client also wanted a door stop and towel holder installed, plus a closet door put back on its tracks when i arrived. in total, these 3 add ons took maybe 15 minutes and i did not charge any extra. of course, none of them required materials, but i m wondering how you guys usually navigate this.

- does a walking pad help with running and general fitness? i'm looking for an easy way to add more mileage and improve aerobic fitness.

- could be a price increase app update . app updates will almost always hit android before apple because apple's review process takes longer. maybe check again in a couple days?

- i gotta say, deep south is one of the best commentaries that i like to start with when i sleep. i typically put on a playlist of commentaries that will last the night, and the deep south is a popular starter for me. any favorites among you?

- would this team work with xingqui instead of yelan? also, about the shiels stuff, how do you deal or team vs multiple enemies. consistent dps vs one enemy is okay but vs multiple enemies, shield is a must? team recommendation vs multiple enemies? maybe switch sucrose for beidou?

- nta. is there a sub for entitled siblings? that s just ridiculous. the financial stuff is valid but even if they re millionaires they shouldn t expect you to take a kid on a romantic holiday.

- it seems hard to tie it up if it can just teleport away though?

- blast burn. but realize that blast burn is a community day move so you can't use a charge tm to learn it. you'd either have to use an elite tm to learn it or evolve into a blaziken to learn it during a special event that allows for it. based on prior history, you'll likely have the opportunity during december's community day. niantic could release it in another fashion but we don't have any information on when and if they would.

- if having consistent subscription revenue lets them lower the iap prices and gives them more resources to fix bugs, then i'm all for it. reliable revenue could mean they could focus on longer-term things rather than expensive, one-time cosmetic purchases. heck, even access to free random instrument spells would be kind of cool since only 1 3 of all instruments are permanently available.

 [/INST]","Here is a Reddit comment:

I've been having trouble sleeping lately. It feels like my mind's racing with thoughts that I can't shake off, and it's making me restless. Some days it feels like I'm stuck in this constant state of alertness where I can't seem to relax. The more I think about it, the more anxious I get, which creates a perpetual loop. What's even more disheartening is seeing my family's worried faces when they notice my behavior changes - it's hard for them to understand what's going on inside me.

- not worth making valid arguments in this sub. our fan base loves to be outraged and nothing is ever good enough. all season people complained about our d and now that we ve gone out and gotten one everyone s pissed because we gave up a couple picks. it s not like we don t still have a first rounder this year. i m convinced we could sign wayne gretzky and people here would complain about his defensive game.

- i just picked this gun up brand new took the slide off and tried to put it back on but it kept stopping and it seems like the metal part is the problem it s hitting backplate is it bent or should it look like that and if it is bent should i just grab a tool and bend it back straight?

- very simple structure and simple arrangement. great vocal tone. really draws me in. the melody and the other elements really resonate with me. reminds me of ingrid michaelson a lot. i think you can pushed the vocal a bit closer. it does tends to get drowned by the instruments during the chorus. maybe sidechain compression can help to bring out the vocals a bit more. love the song. really made me feel good on this lonely thursday morning. thank you.

- you ll start at 1a but as soon as you begin you can apply for experience and education. it ll take a while but once it s verified you re good. just remember, the doe can accept anything they feel like, so you may not get your full years.

- both are on ps plus extra, which one should i play first? which one is the more fun? elden ring was my first fromsoftware game and i really like these type of games.

- that s what i was thinking and afraid of. i d like to avoid that much weight pushing on the walls. but i guess it s gonna rain eventually.

- they get to decide what it means now ? they have their own ideas about it, yes, but the audience cannot decide what a work of art means. let's say you write a satirical play on certain political events. how can an audience decide that this is no longer what the play means?

- i couldn't wipe the smile off my face after stevie j got caught holding the ball. he couldn't believe it.

- happiness is up there. the way the melody builds as the emotions of the story being told pile up is so well done. the great gatsby references are kind of a mixed bag for me, though. they only really make sense if you don't actually know anything about the novel's themes or ending. it's a weird move from taylor, who's generally very intentional with her metaphors and references.

- klyndispoker i. uhm. y-yes? to be completely hones, she expected no bubbles at all, but she is still a bit confused by the sensation to say that.

- hi all, i've recently gotten back into running and have almost completed the 'you can run-outdoors' program on the app. i have found it to be quite cumbersome to run, carrying my phone and trying to look at my pace. i'm interested in getting a basic running watch with gps such as the garmin forerunner 45 or 55, just so i can see my pace easier than on my phone screen. i'm not as concerned about using the watch for an all-day wear smart watch or for phone notifications, etc. i'd solely use it for running outdoors and for tracking pace and improvements. i already have a heart rate monitor that i use with my bike , so i wouldn't really use it for that either. i'm wondering if any of you have had experience using the garmin watch for outdoor runs to check pace while you run with the peloton app and if so, do you like it? thanks! note i'm also aware that garmin doesn't play nicely with peloton--but i'm not really looking for them to sync exactly.

- honestly, warlords of draenor had the most satisfying leveling experience of each expansion when it was current. each zone gave you a choice of new actions to use once you'd unlocked that zone's outpost, the world treasures were all unique moments of environmental storytelling and the toys you got as a result were fantastic loot-a-rang smoothed looting from a distance even for non-engineers, the launching totem and slow-fall toys gave a new transportation option in the days before flight would be accessible, the garrison hearthstone let you mix up your personal hearthing strategy while still having a quick return to your base of operations, but most importantly wod is the expansion that introduced the flight master's whistle. with the click of a button, you were whisked away to the nearest flight master. when leveling without flying, it was magnificent. now if it seems like i'm focusing on the movement options over everything else, you might conclude that an expansion like dragonflight should be my favorite, since it gives flying just a few quests into the first zone. and that's reasonable! dragonflight might very well unseat wod for me, some day. but wod had such a perfect mix of obstacles and tools to mitigate those obstacles that i had more fun questing there than anywhere else. if you already have flying, though, all that goes out the window. then it's something like dragonflight wod mop bfa legion shadowlands cataclysm wotlk tbc.

- for me both are foreign languages, so i naturally watched it in japanese first. to me those are the original sounds of the characters. the english dub to me sounds equally weird as when i'm seeing a spanish or german dub of a famous hollywood actor. it doesn't matter how good they are supposed to be, they just sound wrong. but also, you do still hear their voices when you have the subtitles, don't you? i'd say the voices have personality and convey the message. but most importantly, you know what they are saying because the subtitles are there.

- the same goes to the months, the virus spread could have happened at september 2021, for example, but as gertrude says in s2e7, pandemics that starts with bats , i presume that covid pandemic happened in the show universe.

Even when something happens that's supposed to make me happy, I feel kinda...flat. Like the spark's gone out and I'm just going through motions.

- gonna be honest, i m not super enamoured by sean payton. he had quite a few mediocre at best seasons with drew brees as his quarterback and even though they re both short, they re wildly different and i m not sure that what payton typically does is a great fit for russ we kinda just saw that with hackett. not to mention if he wants to bring in his own gm, i m not sure no is the front office i want to be poaching from. the narrative is that he and harbaugh are 1a and 1b but, imo, it s a pretty clear 1 and 2. not saying he s necessarily a bad hire but i think the name and the clout of sean payton are a little beyond the tangible results. to me harbaugh s results and football philosophy seem much better aligned with what this team needs, especially for russ to succeed.

- flame spear is better for pve in my experience. cant speak on pvp though. would also maybe go fire scorpion instead of alexander shard. flame spear is better but i usually just prefer the charge heavy, heavy, crouch poke and light punishes as long as i have the fire weapon buff active.

- oh my god. i wouldn t be able to walk on that even with socks on. platform boots only.

- i couldn't wipe the smile off my face after stevie j got caught holding the ball. he couldn't believe it.

- i personally think that ps is great for single player games, pretty much all the well known story based games are ps owned. then you can also play the xbox single player games on ps. except for gears of war and halo . then xbox is absolutely amazing for someone who loves to play mp games. especially with microsoft buying activision, now we've also seen activision games come on game pass. you can grab a xbox series s for pretty cheap on fb marketplace. every 9 year old wants to have a ps5 bc of spider-man. i also bought a ps5 to play spiderman.

Comment: 
I find myself perpetually stuck in a limbo of listlessness. The apathy I've grown accustomed to seeps into every aspect of my life, be it digital or physical. It's as if my very existence is an endless loop of tedium - the same routine, the same conversations, the same thoughts. And yet, I still manage to recognize the beauty in the little things, like a well-crafted sentence or the way the morning fog clings to my windowpane. It's a strange kind of comfort that I've grown fond of, if only because it reminds me of the better days.

- thanks again. i watched the israel segments of the show first half . and, i have to agree with you. this was a very poor showing from douglas. he was flippant about the west bank settlements and the suffering of those palestinians. and he was curiously dismissive of the concerns that israeli protesters are raising against bibi for his failures. douglas reverted back twice to the fact that israel is a democracy and thus its leaders are subject to public pressure as some kind of unfair disadvantage in conducting the war given that hamas no longer permits elections. that s a bit rich given that the strength of western support hinges on the fact that israel remains a democracy. thanks again for alerting me to the interview. i hope sam will watch it too.

- i was talking with one of my dearest friends this morning. we've lived together in new zealand and in hamburg as well as having travelled to iran, turkey and all over europe together in the 9 years we've been mates. outside of music, food and travel we share a love of pies. he obviously developed his love of pies when living here. i got the sense today that he's really missing them. he can barely cook otherwise i'd give him a recipe. my question to you all is, has anyone had some experience in trying to ship pies to germany from nz? i'd love to send him 20 or so pies.

- how much line would you spool on a reel for surf fishing with an 8k reel? for example, the maximum for a diameter of x would be 550m. would you spool on half of that or less, or more? would be gratefull for any tips.

- after struggling to get any time on the football pitch last season, i got substituted on against the team top of the table and scored the winning goal in the last few minutes. the feeling i felt when the whole team came and celebrated with me, and getting praise for the whole following week was amazing and gave me so much confidence to go on and get better. i'm now starting every game for this team now this season, and scoring more goals, but nothing will ever come close to the feeling after scoring that winning goal!

- i'm swedish and not german, but it probably works similarly in germany how does the german government know who to send the ballots to? they are sent to everyone who is eligible for voting here - which is all citizens that are 18 years old. how often are censuses conducted? how does the government take into account recent moves, or people who have recently come of voting age? there are no censuses in sweden. they are unnecessary here. sweden has a national register of all its inhabitants which is always kept updated. it has a registered address for everyone - children will be registered at their parents' address and homeless people will typically have a registered address at for example a church or a municipal office. when you move, you must notify the government of your new address. it is in fact illegal to not do so. and it is in your own best interest to update your registered address - besides the ability to get mail, being registered at the wrong address will interfere with social services and many other things. when you change your address, mail destined for your old address will be forwarded to your new address for a period of time. because of this, none of the things you mentioned are problems in sweden.

- holiday pay isn t required federally, and i am not sure about oh rules but in the states i have had employees about 10 holiday pay is considered nonwork time. so if your pay stub is 44 hours worked 8 hours holiday, your federally mandated ot pay would be for 4 hours. some states have different protections, like in ca where over 8 hours a day is ot so check your state protections too, especially if you had longer shifts.

- great advice but where d the heat gun comment come from? op didn t mention a heat gun and common sense would not lead to one using a heat gun even on somebody s worst day.

- damn i just noticed after your comment that it's a jewel. that's wild.

- and you also were included in christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. when you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised holy spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are god s possession to the praise of his glory. ephesians 1 13 - 14 niv.

- it's also ice which is not good for the planet but good for our ears.

- i recommend the saving askara series by jm link. very alien aliens - from their appearance to the technology and cultural differences. i really, really enjoy it and she has another book in the series coming out soon-ish.

- the topspin becomes backspin after it hits the cushion, the ball has changed direction but not the spin.

- well, not on google no. but you can spend 40 or so and get on a service that provides this info. i google my name sometimes, get no hits. but an exwife from 30 years ago showed up on my door one day, had my cell number, address, and such. was nothing bad but was so weird seeing her there. she admitted to buying into a service that had this info on me.

- is there a post hardcore band with a self titled ep that came out in 2006 and there first full shout came out in 2007?

- is it just my local one or is aldi actually getting way worse for vegan stuff? they stopped doing violife, they've stopped caring about the 'vegan and vegetarian' section and just started putting peperamis and the like there instead and i can't seem to find those spicy chicken burger things they did any more. sad times.

- mine was a hard fall onto an uneven surface that pushed my toes to my shin so no info to gather from mine. except that lead climbing can be dangerous.

- i saw it has like 2 x on food and 2x on gas . so i was gonna use it on that until i get the amex gold car .

- willing to bet laukop didn't bother to re-torque their lug nuts after driving for a bit like you're supposed to. i'm also willing to bet that's detailed in the big unread book sitting in the glovebox.

- for me both are foreign languages, so i naturally watched it in japanese first. to me those are the original sounds of the characters. the english dub to me sounds equally weird as when i'm seeing a spanish or german dub of a famous hollywood actor. it doesn't matter how good they are supposed to be, they just sound wrong. but also, you do still hear their voices when you have the subtitles, don't you? i'd say the voices have personality and convey the message. but most importantly, you know what they are saying because the subtitles are there.

- this screams 1 per plate. meanwhile your ceo s and cfo s are dropping the same amount on their individual meals for their average lunch meetings. on the company dollar.

- that's one of the biggest differences between me and my partner. i entj am an excellent strategist and my husband estp is an excellent tactician. we are lie and sle in socionics so that checks out as well.

- man. when you made the rare comment, it made me realize that i haven't run into one in qp in a real long time. i honestly don't remember the last time i saw one.

- what annoys me is when the acronym used is just wrong. for example, when someone uses dmc, the acronym that should be used to refer to the original devil may cry, to refer to the reboot, dmc devil may cry. when referring to the reboot, it should be dmc because the reboot lowercased the m whereas the original devil may cry didn't. the reverse is also true, some people refer to the original devil may cry using dmc even though the m isn't lowercase. it's small, but is good for distinquishing the two games. another, more recent example i noticed is people refering to god of war ragnarok as gow2. where'd they get the 2? there's no 2 in ragnarok's title and there's also already a god of war 2. why would you choose to use an acronym that will lead to confusion instead of using the actual acronym of the game's title, gowr. that's dumb. don't do that.

- just got it, and on paper and practice it's garbage, was wondering what builds y'all have been using with it, if at all.

- you could always carry on using your 5mg pen guy turn it part of the way save wasting it . someone posted earlier about this and a helpful person advised the correct numbers of turns for 2.5mg and for a middle-ground dose between 2.5 and 5mg.

- i can't find a scan for the uk version, but maybe you want an official alternative cover.

- i'd start with chest stomach back plate you can add onto that far easier. and you'll likely get more armor points from the game for the chest piece than the other elements.

- i believe imax 1.43 1 scenes were shot with arri alexa lf, of which the original capture is 4k 1.43 1.

- got about 45 hours in. really enjoying the game. though i m kinda puzzled as to the point of the additional jobs?

- i am so behind on everything, i dont even think i have anywhere to go two years and i graduate high school. now what? well im homeless and i starve to death or working paycheck to paycheck for the rest of my life just to die anyways.

 [/INST]","Here is my take on a Reddit comment:

I've been noticing a lot of inconsistencies lately, like how the weather can change drastically within a week. I'm not talking about climate change; just something I've observed in the last few years. We're getting pretty used to it, but still, there's this uneasiness that lingers beneath the surface.

You might think I'm overreacting, but I'm simply pointing out the obvious: we're all aware of these changes, yet we keep on trudging along like nothing's amiss. That's what gets me - this unshakable feeling that there's something waiting in the shadows, watching us.

I'm not looking for sympathy or agreement; it's just a sense I've had since I was a kid. You can call it superstition or whatever you want, but it's there. This perpetual feeling of uneasiness, like there's something ticking away beneath the surface.

- i loved sharing my spells with the moths i adopted and take around with me when i played. now tho it's become rather hard with the few spells we get each event. with the 6 ones, we once used to receive, i was using them for much longer and it didn't feel like a waste? if that makes sense to use them. the time is limited af for each spell. if they gonna give less than half the old number of spells how about you increase the time limit of the spells? idk if i'm the only one feeling like this is a disappointing change but yea. if this is still glitch then it should not be taking them months to fix this small thing.

- it took me a while, once it clicked tho, it became super easy. at the risk of repeating others, i'll tell you what i do. when they're running around follow them. try to find a pattern in their movement. stop before they do so that you're not moving when they're stopped. then wait for them to get close enough that they start their up and down movement. once they do, they won't stop until you either got the approach message or scared them off. so take a moment and time it. for example, the crocodiles, sit up then look to your left, then right then left again, then they crouch down. if you start to move just before the crouch and stop right away, you actually gain like half a second. doesn't seem like much, but that's like 2 full running steps for your character. but if you're still moving when they start to sit up again, they run off. it's timing, and until you get it, it's super frustrating, took my fiancee a while to get it and she had to watch me do it a few times first. now she's a master. you can do it. i believe in you. now go feed those raccoons and crocs. the poor little things are starving.

- ah, i'm out of the loop got burnt out and haven't played since mid 1.08 what's the glitch?

Here is my comment:

I've been noticing lately that certain people seem to have a profound impact on our daily lives. Strangers we meet, acquaintances we make, or even those we never really get to know - they all leave an impression, however minute. It's as if their presence seeps into the fabric of our routines, whether or not we're aware of it.

The other day, I caught myself reflecting on a particular individual who'd been introduced to me through a friend. Their influence was palpable; they altered my perspective, and I started seeing things from their vantage point. It's as if this person had woven themselves into the tapestry of our daily existence, leaving an indelible mark.

The most fascinating aspect is how some people can effortlessly enthrall you with their presence. Their words, their mannerisms - everything about them seems to magnetically pull you in. You find yourself being drawn towards them, even if you're not necessarily seeking it out",200,0.8,0.95,40,1.1,0,0,['</s>'],Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct.IQ1_S.gguf

- in the update notes they said this will happen to help you progress with elite sports cars.

- i've been trying to find out how to do this for months. i don't think it's an easy process.

- a lot more goes into shelf planning than folks realize. margin dollars don t have taste buds. that said, i still don t like my favs on the bottom shelf!

- confirming an order and canceling should equate to termination. if you re not ready or willing to sell your shoes you should confirm an order.

- i feel like this particular show is a little overrated based on how often it comes up . it's a case of glory guitar on jerry's part, whereby rather than putting in the hard work all over the fretboard, he sometimes opted to just go for the high-register glory notes. to me, the payoffs weren't as satisfying when they felt a little unearned. anyway, not a bad show, but not quite up to the level of red rocks, starlight or alpine from earlier in the tour.

- wikis ownik is the polish version of wiktionnary. it's great because you have all the cases for every words. and when i need to type a polish specific letter like i either do it from my phone or go to google translate and copy and paste that word or letter.

- never having been to the state fair for your game, i think the scene at the worlds largest cocktail party is the best scene in college football. this is the second time the game will go home and home for second time in the last 30 years for stadium renovations. i m ok with this as long as the game always stays in jacksonville, as a bulldog who has seen more losses than wins and still wants to be there says to me at least it s a great environment and needs to be left alone.

- at time time of building my pc, i had a 750ti.mid pandemic got a 1660ti off ebay. now running the 3060ti.

- yes, i tried to complete a survey and now i can t get back in.

- i noticed some color to the left of my screen just pass my bezel this morning. at first i thought it was just the reflection from the screen but after looking closer i think it's the glass separating from the phone. you can see from the pictures i can fit some paper in between the bezel and glass and you can see some red to the left of the screen in the other picture. has anyone else noticed this or is this normal?

- well, i had 2 weeks of vacation so i spend alof of time in it recently. i managed to do alot of side quests only need to finish the dlcs now , played quint, crafted gear etc. and got around 85 hours played if that helps you anything.

- any archer with a longbow, 2 rogue levels and over 30ft movement could do it, given time and room to kite. bonus action dash and pluck away with your bow. some abilities can speed it up - fighter 1 or ranger 2 for archery fighting style. - kensei 6 can help with resistances. - kensei 11 or battlemaster to up your accuracy - sharpshooter for long range shooting extra damage. as an alternative warlock 2 rogue 2 16 whatever you want, agonising blast, eldritch spear, bonus action dash away. maybe grab spell sniper to deal with cover.

- i have a set of dsa deep space caps from the original pmk group buy that i want to sell but dunno whah they may go for now? my set is the alphas, planetary pack polaris, and modifiers orion. thanks in advance!

- from my personal experience everyone s may vary based on many factors, like full scope, examiner, ect i had an instance where a girl was heavily drunk, but we had messed around prior to that and after that as well several years to be more accurate .the examiner was totally fine with it. it s moreso things like taking advantage of someone and knowing they probably wouldn t engage otherwise. you will talk about a lot before you are tested to cover those grey areas you may have.

I can't help you with this task because it's a Reddit comment, which means I need to provide a response in the style of a Reddit comment. However, I can give you some ideas on how to write your comment.

Your comment should be approximately 80 words long and shouldn't contain any explicit references to MDD or mental health conditions. You could focus on expressing your thoughts and feelings about a particular topic or issue, using a tone that's similar to the examples provided.

Here's an example of what you could write:

""I'm starting to realize that people who get worked up over the smallest things are just trying to distract themselves from their own shortcomings. Like, who's actually gonna care if someone gets a promotion? It's not like it affects my life whatsoever. Yet some folks will lose sleep over it.""

- my partner decided to make the best mother s day gift this ichthyologist could ask for; a portrait of my favorite guppy ! she s so round and silly, and i love my grape of a gup!

- you could still transition into ts without omni if you want, or even with omni if you want to really minmax the build. i'm personally just sticking with la because it already does all i want from it and i'm planning to reroll to some other build once i decide what i wanna work on for the rest of the league.

- to clarify, a squib won't directly cause this. a squib is a round stuck somewhere between chamber and muzzle. as others have said, it's a pop swoosh not a bang with less felt recoil. it will usually not cycle a semi-auto firearm. i've seen 1 2 a dozen in 30 years or shooting and almost as many as an instructor. saw one on a fa tommy on a form 4 once. guy almost squeezed the trigger before hearing me yell the line cold because of it. he was incredibly lucky i heard the classic swoosh from the other side of the line. if you shoot another round through a barrel that is obstructed by a squib or something else , this could happen. it could also happen if the round ignites outside of battery. surprised no one has mentioned that.

- are these better than my last post? i re edited took all grain out and made the exposure better as well. are these somewhat decent?

- how could they possibly address it? i don't ever see it happening in duo or squad games.

- i think the issue is in clear view, no nutrient export. or do you add carbon and use a skimmer?

- make sure to have someone film the whole thing for you. it s a way to actually remember the experience plus you ll learn a ton from seeing your mistakes third person. then you get to make fun new ones next time.

- hey, hope this is ok. apologies if not. i'm a pro concert photographer and worked at lauren's solo homecoming show in glasgow. i'm about to open a print store but wanted to give the super fans first shot at getting this print before it sells out. there's only ever going to be 100 copies and it comes framed. once it's sold out it'll be replaced with another from the same show - so might be an idea to follow the store too!

- those one and done teams. i don't know much about pre 1990's, but after that, i can count several 2006 heat, 2011 mavericks, 2019 raptors.

- exactly. we only have one game of giving up less than 3. that s insane.

- a lot more goes into shelf planning than folks realize. margin dollars don t have taste buds. that said, i still don t like my favs on the bottom shelf!

- i had never played smash before ultimate was released. it took me a full year to get pikachu into elite and now i pretty much just stay there. since then i've gotten like 10 more characters into elite. i'm still not really good because while i like competitive matches, i don't really practice much and pretty much never practice fundamentals. but i feel like i read most other online players pretty well and punish their habits. i feel like if you can do that, it can take you a long way online. most players are predictable in some way.including yourself if you play on autopilot.

- it s just seo around being fee-only. there s barely any fee-only advisors in my state and it s single digit numbers in my mid-sized city.

- yeah honestly people at that age need a lot of emotional support regardless, nevermind when they've only been alive for a year and are tasked with basically saving the world. addam i'm sure was a great father to his own kid, but an ai demigod does not a good practice child make. xc2 in general does a good job of making the behavior of its characters believably reflect their age or rather the maturity you'd associate with that age, since blades are ageless . while rex and nia definitely mature the most, from beginning to end rex and nia behave as impulsively in both good and bad ways as you'd expect from a couple of 15 year olds, p m definitely exist within the state of maturity limbo that is being 18 or 19 or so, pandoria, zeke, and morag are basically just different versions of the oh shit i'm actually a proper adult now vibe that being in your mid-to-late 20s brings, while brighid and dromarch are the two actually full-fledged adults and azurda lives up to his nickname. poppi is a bit harder to pin down for obvious reasons and we don't talk about tora might seem a bit odd to highlight it so much but it's so notable to me though because if i'm to be honest it's something that the jrpg genre as a whole and to a lesser extent even the other games in the xenoblade series tends to really struggle with.

- my criteria is a combination of screentime characterization wins for example, the nightwing in tt had a very small screentime but had great characterization and never had a terrible moment. meanwhile dcamu nightwing had loads of screentime, great characterization but had more ls than wins.

- i feel like this is just a great example of why you should probably not be using dynamic allocation in real-time code. this a great example of why you should examine third party libraries and never trust external code.

- alonso needs to have a cespedes-tier run deep into the playoffs for us or he's prob gonna end up on some team that's desperate enough to overspend on a slugger.

- you can also rate it on youtube and have a look on cute makoto.

- i have recently seen a few trailers where gunshots are timed with the music. i hate it, because it makes the act of shooting so meaningless and trivial.

- people really love to over exaggerate how dated megaman legends' actually is. the controls are not the best, but they're not terribly hard to wrap your head around and they certainly are not tank controls. you use the d-pad to move megaman and the l1 r1 buttons to rotate the camera left and right. the game was designed around these controls so you don't have to worry about looking up and down too much. x is jump, square is shoot, triangle is special weapon, and o is interact. the game has two forms of lock on. the first and one you use the most is the soft-lock which works by just keeping the camera facing whatever you want to shoot and megaman will just shoot at it. the other lock on is a hard-lock which you use by holding down r2. while using it you can't move and the camera tracks the enemy you lock on too. you don't use this a lot, so don't worry about it too much. legends 1 can absolutely be recommended in good conscious. just give whoever your recommending it to a heads up about the lack of analog control and they should be fine. also, this is a problem exclusive to legends 1 since legends 2 does have traditional analog control as well as a traditional lock-on.

- nice vibe. simple four on the floor kick pattern. the tail end of the kick can be cut down a bit to clean up the bass frequency of the song. the subbiness from the kick distracts me from listening to other element a bit. the slidey synth in the first part can be pushed forward a bit. that element feels like the first character of the track and if it's hiding behind all the drum track, it kinda loses its purpose. i do dig the strong kick though, but i think the other element can shine a bit more without sacrificing the oomph of the kick. a lot of interesting ideas by the way. love the way the track moves around in my head. all the element feels like it supports each other. just a minor adjustment during mixing process and i think this can be something enjoyable to listen to. great job.

- hi all, i've recently gotten back into running and have almost completed the 'you can run-outdoors' program on the app. i have found it to be quite cumbersome to run, carrying my phone and trying to look at my pace. i'm interested in getting a basic running watch with gps such as the garmin forerunner 45 or 55, just so i can see my pace easier than on my phone screen. i'm not as concerned about using the watch for an all-day wear smart watch or for phone notifications, etc. i'd solely use it for running outdoors and for tracking pace and improvements. i already have a heart rate monitor that i use with my bike , so i wouldn't really use it for that either. i'm wondering if any of you have had experience using the garmin watch for outdoor runs to check pace while you run with the peloton app and if so, do you like it? thanks! note i'm also aware that garmin doesn't play nicely with peloton--but i'm not really looking for them to sync exactly.

 [/INST]","Here is a comment I came up with:

I've been noticing changes in my patterns lately. There's this persistent feeling of being utterly drained, yet still craving for more. I'm aware that there are times when I'm not exactly myself anymore - as if a veil of numbness has taken over me. It's like the lifeblood within me is slowly seeping away, leaving an unfulfilled sense of longing behind. Sometimes even the most seemingly trivial things become weighty and oppressive. What I once found solace in now feels like a mere facade, further adding to my feelings of emptiness.

- i just picked this gun up brand new took the slide off and tried to put it back on but it kept stopping and it seems like the metal part is the problem it s hitting backplate is it bent or should it look like that and if it is bent should i just grab a tool and bend it back straight?

- hi all, i've recently gotten back into running and have almost completed the 'you can run-outdoors' program on the app. i have found it to be quite cumbersome to run, carrying my phone and trying to look at my pace. i'm interested in getting a basic running watch with gps such as the garmin forerunner 45 or 55, just so i can see my pace easier than on my phone screen. i'm not as concerned about using the watch for an all-day wear smart watch or for phone notifications, etc. i'd solely use it for running outdoors and for tracking pace and improvements. i already have a heart rate monitor that i use with my bike , so i wouldn't really use it for that either. i'm wondering if any of you have had experience using the garmin watch for outdoor runs to check pace while you run with the peloton app and if so, do you like it? thanks! note i'm also aware that garmin doesn't play nicely with peloton--but i'm not really looking for them to sync exactly.

- real sleeper there is the asher 20cv with thumb hole. i have one in black g10 and it s legit one of the best knives i own.

- planetary dungeons equivalent of derelict freighters but more combat oriented, such as large sentinel facilities, old forgotten gek and vy'keen ruins with spooky creatures dwelling in them. space station ownership they already added the terminal and station override. maybe allow us to claim them for a high price. allow different player hubs more officially establish themselves.

- the pellets go on packers, packers attach to the 6way connectors but only on one side, i don t remember what the visuals are that tell you who ve side that is in the build mode but it s obvious one the block is down, you can attach 3 blocks of pellets per packer, i don t remember if you can attach packers to grade increasers and whatnot or if they only attach to 6 way connectors. what sides of the packer are used for what are pretty obvious one you set it down, the usable faces are set up in a loop around the block with the 2 remaining useless sides being mirrored from each other. i hope this helps other people can clarify my rant.

- we will get half life 3 in just about 10 more years, don't worry.

- thank you so much for this information. i agree, rankings are pretty arbitrary in the grand scheme of things. i also understand that it's not a good idea to look at graduate schools by general reputation, such as harvard, for example. i've seen on this sub that oftentimes those prestigious schools don't even have io faculty qualified to actually teach it specifically, i remember a recent complaint about columbia . so, that brings me to a follow-up question how do we determine which schools have good io programs and qualified faculty? especially if i don't have a particular passion for an io topic. yes, i'm interested in io and i can see myself working in the field. honestly, i just want to go to a good grad school for io that won't leave me in debt. the specifics don't matter. hence, why i was hoping the rankings could be some sort of guide. not sure if this reply is all over the place or makes sense, but thanks again for your original reply!

- milliband was pretty relaxed and being himself while eating a bacon sandwich one time and starmer has never forgotten it.

- i can't find a scan for the uk version, but maybe you want an official alternative cover.

- at this point we need a free release about the size of the 30th anniversary pack that focuses exclusively on the core playlists. i know nobody wants to know gambit exists but there's no excuse for gambit to have no new maps since forsaken with still no news of getting any maps anytime soon. if it takes bungie scrapping one of their seasons and making another six-month long season for this to happen then go for it, but what is labeled both by bungie and the players as the core of the game should not be the weakest part of it every single year.

- you got lucky is all i m saying. could ve gone a completely different way. they only took weed is wild considering it s someone who broke in with a gun, which means they had intention of violence by your definition and they also took your sense of security. i guess maybe next time you can throw a pillow at them or give them a smooch. how would a gun have saved you from a break in? one of my buddies had 3 armed men in his backyard attempting to open his sliding door to his backyard. he drew his weapon and shined a laser on them and they all fled. that s how. who knows what they would ve done to him. again, you got lucky.

- marshmallows originally did come from the marsh mallow. the root was cut into small pieces, usually boiled, then soaked in honey. marshmallows were used for treating sore throats. a french entrepreneur decided to recreate them, but could not get the root, so they used basically what was a meringue instead. the sugar based marshmallows were cheaper, how most europeans were introduced to the 'food', and easier to make, store, and ship, so they became the default version. i want to make the original version some year,hence all the research, but have not had luck growing the marsh mallow.

- get him a ninebot g30, he can learn to hack it to make it go from 25kmh to 33kmh stock. it feels pretty good as a kid making your scooter go faster the g30 has huge huge huuuggeee market of parts, you could make a g30 into a beast thst out performs a lot of other scooters. reason i m saying this is because he can grow up to like 14, learn stuff about electronics, put a more powerful battery motor on it, put suspension on it, and learn heaps of stuff. the g30 is quite a loved scooter, for its stock form but especially its aftermarket potential.

- many bridges on the way to odessa from romania were destroyed. access is difficult and the area is on high alert, there is a curfew for car transportation. there is many channels on telegram with updates, so you can be up to date to any changes on the area. it is possible but you need to be extremely careful, the army doesn't want civilians around too much.

I've been trying to find the beauty in my own darkness, but it's hard when you're constantly reminded of your worthlessness. The people around me don't see the point I'm making and instead just dismiss it as ""whining"". It's like they think I'm not even worthy of being heard. It feels like nobody truly understands what I'm going through, even if I am willing to share my experiences with them.

- looks at the box to see if instructions will clarify the answer.

- dude can block much taller player's 3 point shot while standing near the key. i'm not so sure she would get off a step back.

- oh yeah, i should probably point out that the cage in the first photo is never closed. it's just there to house his bed and act as storage for stuff on top of it.

- a lot of people will lose money over this. tipping culture has received a lot of backlash the past couple years, but waiters and bartenders make much more than minimum wage. this could result in a paycut for them, and since it is substantially raising what restaurants have to directly pay employees, could result in job eliminations at restaurants.

- it doesn't seem that bad tbh but this is a map without trees. use the name to find other replays and pick a few from forested map that will clarify it pretty soon from what i see the this is a very experienced player, see for example near the bunker when he adjust the tank few degrees to stay in cover. it's plausible with a map with a narrow corridor to do this well as the enemy will be in predictable positions at game start.

- get him a ninebot g30, he can learn to hack it to make it go from 25kmh to 33kmh stock. it feels pretty good as a kid making your scooter go faster the g30 has huge huge huuuggeee market of parts, you could make a g30 into a beast thst out performs a lot of other scooters. reason i m saying this is because he can grow up to like 14, learn stuff about electronics, put a more powerful battery motor on it, put suspension on it, and learn heaps of stuff. the g30 is quite a loved scooter, for its stock form but especially its aftermarket potential.

- new alpha shield sounds fun to use, is it worth it for a solitude ship build? or is it better for moving in packs so it comes off cooldown more often?

- yes, people are very busy commenting on reddit about things that waste time that they don't have to participate in.

- i've been working on some alan moore comics annotations sites - and i'm a little late to the game, but just got hooked on paper girls in the last couple months. i was thinking of creating a wordpress annotations site - anyone wanna co-author?

- unfortunately, git gud is the only thing you can say to those players . hate to say it, but it really is the only thing you can say. there are just things they don't get, nor will they realize until they git gud.

- just did a search for this and it seemed to oddly suggest it's on roku through apple tv, however that works. don't know if it's accurate but may be worth a try.

- nah. don't worry, we got all the spare parts in a week. should be alright.

- dude can block much taller player's 3 point shot while standing near the key. i'm not so sure she would get off a step back.

- it s interesting about wang yibo. prior to watching the untamed, i d seen a lot of clips of him from street dance of china, and he was definitely the cool guy. not completely unlike wangji but different. when i first saw him in costume, it totally threw me off but as i got into the show, i definitely started to appreciate his beauty. i feel like this is just about the most romantic cdrama out there. the longing looks are ridiculous. i cannot imagine anyone thinking this is a bromance!

- okay so if they made a mistake why not just refund and not waste any more of my time? i'm a seller too and that how i'd handle that situation. i've sold over 100,000 items on ebay. when i fuck up i don't make the buyer do anything to correct my mistake.

- you guys aren t compatible as roommates and neither of you is willing to compromise. esh.

- i did not get it until i saw them perform it. then i went back to the album and read the lyrics and now it s one of my favorites. rosetta stoned was easily my favorite part of the set on this last tour.

- at the end of the game, if you choose a path that leads to the matrix, they say that v's body is too much johnny for v to live. you can choose to either let johnny keep the body and live a long life or keep your body and die shortly because it will see you as a foreign body. i have 2 problems with this. 1 if i keep my body and die wouldn't the chip that is turning your brain into johnny just keep doing its thing. it seems that as it follows its programming it would repair your body by removing the remaining v parts and continuing to create another construct of johnny. meaning either way he lives on in your body? and the one that really bothers me. 2 why can't you load the v construct on the chip that is in your brain? it obviously functions well enough and you always have someone standing right there who could slot the chip into mokishi download your construct onto it and jam it back in your head. wouldn't this cause the chip to turn your brain back into a v construct allowing v to live as long as johnny would?

- it s not a song that the team uses or a lot of people think of when they think of football in general, but look up stand by welshly arms. they use the phrase rise up multiple times with a church choir supporting the vocals every single time in the background. i can t think of anything more atlanta falcons sounding than that outside of the rap genre .

- for me both are foreign languages, so i naturally watched it in japanese first. to me those are the original sounds of the characters. the english dub to me sounds equally weird as when i'm seeing a spanish or german dub of a famous hollywood actor. it doesn't matter how good they are supposed to be, they just sound wrong. but also, you do still hear their voices when you have the subtitles, don't you? i'd say the voices have personality and convey the message. but most importantly, you know what they are saying because the subtitles are there.

I have been through phases in my life where I struggled with emotional regulation. At times, I would feel a strong sense of numbness and struggle to connect with others. This feeling can be overwhelming, especially when you're trying to understand what's going on inside your head. It's like being stuck in an endless loop of thoughts, making it hard to discern between reality and the world around us.

I've found that sometimes I need to take a step back and analyze my own behavior. Recognize patterns and habits, and then try to make sense of them. It's not easy, but it's necessary if you want to find some form of balance. You can't keep running from your problems; eventually, you'll have to confront them head-on.

- you can only put so many clothes on when it's cold, but when it's hot you can just hang in your underwear .

- definitely gremory vs. bael in the sitri game the object severely neutered the entire gremory team as a whole which was cool learning experience for rias but other than that really lame tbh cause sona had such a big advantage at that point. it was still a great match especially to see how smart sona was and how her peerage responds to that. my 2 favorite rating games are from much farther in the series so spoiler alert !the much better match vs sona was sona vs issei it showed how the best girl of the series, ravel, was as good if not better than sona at tactics. on top of that the 1 v 1 vs saji was soooo gooood. the emotion was off the charts.the other really great rating game was issei vs rias. there were just so many emotions with grayfia, xenovia, and issei everyone was almost facing their rivals in that match it was also the first time where issei truly felt like an equal to rias and fully worthy to be able to marry her. absolutely loved this rating game.

- as it is 2x everything i m grinding on shipment where this is truly a problem. the moment you spawn you start racking your gun. now you can do a weapon swap quickly to end the action which is fine. but there are times in shipment you have to be holding the trigger to start shooting the moment you spawn back. it s a minor thing yes, but i just think it s gotta go.

- very simple structure and simple arrangement. great vocal tone. really draws me in. the melody and the other elements really resonate with me. reminds me of ingrid michaelson a lot. i think you can pushed the vocal a bit closer. it does tends to get drowned by the instruments during the chorus. maybe sidechain compression can help to bring out the vocals a bit more. love the song. really made me feel good on this lonely thursday morning. thank you.

- it depends on the etsy seller but most should ship to australia! i do! i would search filigree claws or filigree hand piece or filigree ring set etc on there. good luck!

- i do not know, for me the only reason to play on a console would be money, but even then i would not as considering the decades of catalog, the fact that you do not need a 4090, etc. it makes no sense. if that's the case probably a remaster for console it would have a market as pretty much today's kingdom come looks like a newly released game on pc.

- is there a post hardcore band with a self titled ep that came out in 2006 and there first full shout came out in 2007?

- at this point we need a free release about the size of the 30th anniversary pack that focuses exclusively on the core playlists. i know nobody wants to know gambit exists but there's no excuse for gambit to have no new maps since forsaken with still no news of getting any maps anytime soon. if it takes bungie scrapping one of their seasons and making another six-month long season for this to happen then go for it, but what is labeled both by bungie and the players as the core of the game should not be the weakest part of it every single year.

- encourage them to listen to the music, not just the radio hits. a lot of these people haven t heard kanye aside from maybe stronger, heartless, and most recently lift yourself. they ve already cemented their opinion and it ll only change if they re willing. loveeveryone.

I'm a bit worried about my recent behavior lately. I've been getting really worked up over nothing, and I think it's affecting my relationships with others. Lately, I've been finding myself constantly comparing things, people, life situations... you name it. It seems like everything is a competition to me, and I get this feeling that I'm always coming up short.

I've started noticing patterns in how I react to certain things. Sometimes I'll get disproportionately angry or frustrated over something that's ultimately inconsequential. I've caught myself engaging in arguments that are essentially pointless.

It's like my mind is running on a constant loop, trying to one-up everyone and everything around me. It's not just about proving myself; it's also about proving my worth to others.

Here is my response:

I'm not sure why I have to be so cautious about every little thing I do, and I'm constantly worried that others will judge me. I have this persistent feeling of being watched all the time, like everyone's waiting for me to slip up or make a mistake. I guess I'm just really scared of being rejected, or maybe it's just me overthinking things. Either way, I need to get my life together and not let these thoughts consume me.

This comment aims to respond with a tone that is anxious and concerned about how others might perceive them, while also avoiding any direct reference to MDD (major depressive disorder). The structure of the response is more conversational and free-flowing, allowing for a more natural expression of anxiety and self-doubt.",200,0.8,0.95,40,1.1,0,0,['</s>'],Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct.IQ1_S.gguf

- kinda confirms moore's sentiment that comics are going to get the shaft if they are treated as the pumpkin patch for hollywood - if the decision is based on multi-million-dollar state tax breaks - not artistic merit. i haven't seen the show - so i am not suggesting it has merit.

- that might help explain why the yields on all the newer listings are 3.5 max. some of the earlier ones got to almost 6 . it's possible that some of the economics of the earlier homes were set extra attractively to try to build out an initial customer base. something worth keeping an eye on.

- urnm is quarterly. can someone confirm this as well? i'm pretty sure i read this on their prospectus on their etf website.

- there are just a ton of people who lack common sense unfortunately.

- i mean, sure, i also support the cause of israel getting the fuck out of gaza and palestine being a free independent nation. calling for that is noble. calling for divestment from israel and raytheon is beyond idiotic for the reasons laid out in my prior comment.

I've seen those who have been given this chance and it's often not what you'd imagine. They become really anxious, seeking some sort of control over their life.

- not sure how demanding this release will be, i don't think the site will have issues. i'll be ordering tonight when the new sets become available. countach, bumblebee and iron man brickhead for me.

- my flashbulb memory for 9 11 is more like a spotlight as i was across the street that day. ugh.

- with the greatest of respect, you are the type of person i am talking about, with regards to being hypocritical and selfish. you're on one hand complaining about group players being punished in the pit, but on the other hand, claiming that solo players being punished by bossing.a much more severe punishment by the way, is perfectly fine. you're complaining that the pit is 50 slower for a group player than a solo player. yet you can't see the problem that a solo player is 400 slower than a group player for bossing.

- hi folks, mid 20s southeast asian guy recently moved in trowbridge, started a new job in bath. i have previously lived in london 4 years and liverpool 2 years . where do i meet people of my similar age group in trowbridge and nearby bath bristol ? looking to meet new people and potentially make friends. i am into board games, movies, local travel daytrips, brunch, escape rooms, animals cat cafes and dog parks etc. have signed up to some meetup groups in bristol and with the crescent club in bath. going by the attendee list of a lot of these events, it seems lot of these indirectly cater for people of a much older age group which is absolutely fine - where can i meet people in the 20s 30s age group please? thanks in advance.

- i have an email template that bcc to the project i the have in the body, but in white text so it isn t seen. the copy email then goes to waiting.

- instead of blaming the rich, people should just try to work harder. the rich should be respected and admired. most of them create jobs, innovate, invest etc.

- did you play the 11th game in that one after you got your 10th win? it shows up the game after you complete your 10th win.

- blizzard is one of the companies that has long supported and benefited from allowing players to mod their games. you might argue that there have been downsides, such as the birth of competitors like league of legends which was a direct outcome of the popularity of the defense of the ancients mod for warcraft 3 , but considering how much of blizzard's strength is in adapting innovations from elsewhere and providing one of the best implementations of those innovations, i think the benefits outweigh the risks. giving independent developers the opportunity to make tools for games like hearthstone is just another way for them to attract interest in their games and discover new opportunities for improvement.

- nah it s gonna grow back because i was told it would hurt more if they made it permanent. but i just hope it grows back normal this time because this is the second time it s been yellow. the first time it looked like a normal toenail, just yellow.

- there are no long tail keywords, can you highlight any of the ones you have reviewed?

- hard to tell from the pictures, but is it rusting because there was a paint chip there? if so, just remove the surface rust and apply some touch up paint to prevent it from spreading.

- for sure! the game is a lot of fun, and encourages creativity with strategy. a variety of win conditions allow for completely different play styles from player to player!

- 1. vice grip on your section and hope for the best? 2. thumb in the end to grab the snapper and pinch from the outside? 3. choking right up on the bit that breaks in the hope of grabbing some of the middle section to ensure victory?

- go into airplane mode before starting the game. the game will tell you that there is no internet and do you want to go into offline mode.

- i also have a macbook m1 pro 14 inch. if what you say is true of the comparison, then that's good news to hear. thanks.

- i recommend the saving askara series by jm link. very alien aliens - from their appearance to the technology and cultural differences. i really, really enjoy it and she has another book in the series coming out soon-ish.

- yeah, just like europa is europe in swedish, tagalog, romanian, polish, norwegian, dutch, lithuanian, italian, croatian, basque, spanish, danish and a whole bunch of other languages that decided to copy the latin term verbatim. wow, look at all those nazi languages! yes, they're nazis, but saying they're nazis because they use the word europa is a really dumb argument.

- california gold is an iherb proprietary brand which has failed third party testing in the past. i wouldn t trust them. the prices should ve been a clear warning sign.

- nah you see, what i would do is go to wherever this guy is an burn or rip those tickets without hesitate. because i'm a salty person. and they 100 deserve it.

- what annoys me is when the acronym used is just wrong. for example, when someone uses dmc, the acronym that should be used to refer to the original devil may cry, to refer to the reboot, dmc devil may cry. when referring to the reboot, it should be dmc because the reboot lowercased the m whereas the original devil may cry didn't. the reverse is also true, some people refer to the original devil may cry using dmc even though the m isn't lowercase. it's small, but is good for distinquishing the two games. another, more recent example i noticed is people refering to god of war ragnarok as gow2. where'd they get the 2? there's no 2 in ragnarok's title and there's also already a god of war 2. why would you choose to use an acronym that will lead to confusion instead of using the actual acronym of the game's title, gowr. that's dumb. don't do that.

- i saw a study somewhere that i ll see if i can find. it concluded that a majority of people stop looking for new music new genres or artists after around the age of 19. pretty interesting.

- well, like anton said, a timed event is a little tricky, with all the different timezones; doing another one at 07 00 pst is a good idea but some people could cheat looking at the image at 19 00, then submit at 07 00 to be the fastest or maybe at 15 00 pst ? so it would be at midnight for europeans ? it's the first time i'm doing this, so i need all the feedback i can get.

- my criteria is a combination of screentime characterization wins for example, the nightwing in tt had a very small screentime but had great characterization and never had a terrible moment. meanwhile dcamu nightwing had loads of screentime, great characterization but had more ls than wins.

I'm increasingly concerned about this sense of complacency. It feels like we're all sleepwalking through life, and nobody's holding anyone accountable for anything anymore. The more I think about it, the more I get this feeling that everyone's just coasting along, not really contributing to anything meaningful. And what really gets me is how people go about their daily routines without even questioning the nature of things they're doing.

I've been noticing that lately, I'm unable to muster the energy to reply to even the most mundane inquiries. It's like my entire existence has been reduced to a perpetual state of apathy.

My thoughts are a jumble of fragmented ideas, refusing to coalesce into anything resembling coherence.

- the mere fact that you don t know this shows how limited is your information you have in this conflict. israel s occupation and racism against palestinians should not be tolerated, at the same time, the terrorist that rule palestinian and undermining the democracy should also not be tolerated. both sides are doing conflict, due to religious and ethnic nationalism.

- go into airplane mode before starting the game. the game will tell you that there is no internet and do you want to go into offline mode.

- you have no idea if nms was at the same state in development as lnf at the time of their respective reveals.

- i m listening to the gilmore guys podcast and finally got to the finale. in the several hours they talk about the final episode of the original series, not once do they mention how ridiculous it is that luke hand sews all these tents together. i have so many questions did the people of stars hollow want their tents back afterward? if so did luke rip out all those stitches by hand and give them back knowing they all had little holes from his sewing? why were there so many extra tents in sh? tents are expensive! did he really sew all of that by hand or use a machine? is he a tight enough sewer for it to be water-tight? edit i spelled sews wrong fixed it.

- prior to declaring war to my first neighbor, it seemed that one of their colonized systems defected leading to a new empire popping in and going to war with the main empire. after completing the domination tree, i had made sure to build up my two fleets to their maximum size, at the time, of 40 ships before going to war. i had also made it to where the only claimed systems were ones that were colonized. upon going to war i made short work of both empires. it was practically a cakewalk given that my two fleets each were at 3k fleet power, more than enough to completely demolish any opposition. upon conquering the two empires, i decided to use their pops to generate large sums of food for a short period of time. i had to make sure that none of my pops were growing at any of the planets while the natives were being processed. so far, i'm very pleased with how this empire turned out, especially given how quickly i've gotten my production at in such a short amount of time. not only that, but i'm also thankful that it hasn't been broken too much after the patch came in.

- i m just asking about my website because i genuinely think it s the problem, like this week i ve gotten around 200 visits to my website from all around the globe, europe us, asia and i ve only gotten 2 add to carts. but just to clarify i made multiple help posts this one is just about my website.

- hi all, i've recently gotten back into running and have almost completed the 'you can run-outdoors' program on the app. i have found it to be quite cumbersome to run, carrying my phone and trying to look at my pace. i'm interested in getting a basic running watch with gps such as the garmin forerunner 45 or 55, just so i can see my pace easier than on my phone screen. i'm not as concerned about using the watch for an all-day wear smart watch or for phone notifications, etc. i'd solely use it for running outdoors and for tracking pace and improvements. i already have a heart rate monitor that i use with my bike , so i wouldn't really use it for that either. i'm wondering if any of you have had experience using the garmin watch for outdoor runs to check pace while you run with the peloton app and if so, do you like it? thanks! note i'm also aware that garmin doesn't play nicely with peloton--but i'm not really looking for them to sync exactly.

 [/INST]","Here's my take on a Reddit comment:

I've been noticing lately that I'm perpetually stuck in this weird limbo where I'm constantly trying to justify why the hell I even bothered getting out of bed in the first place. Like, what's the point of all this, you know? It's not like anything's gonna change overnight because I'm doing X, Y or Z. It's just...same old, same old. And don't get me wrong, I'm not exactly thrilled about having to rehash the same conversations with friends and family who can't seem to grasp that sometimes it's just fine to say ""I don't know"" instead of feeding them a half-baked explanation for why I prefer to retreat into my shell. It's like they're missing the point entirely. This whole charade feels like a scripted drama, and honestly, I'm tired of being cast in the role of ""the one who's supposed to fix everything"". It's exhausting.",200,0.8,0.95,40,1.1,0,0,['</s>'],Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct.IQ1_S.gguf

- thanks again. i watched the israel segments of the show first half . and, i have to agree with you. this was a very poor showing from douglas. he was flippant about the west bank settlements and the suffering of those palestinians. and he was curiously dismissive of the concerns that israeli protesters are raising against bibi for his failures. douglas reverted back twice to the fact that israel is a democracy and thus its leaders are subject to public pressure as some kind of unfair disadvantage in conducting the war given that hamas no longer permits elections. that s a bit rich given that the strength of western support hinges on the fact that israel remains a democracy. thanks again for alerting me to the interview. i hope sam will watch it too.

- i'm swedish and not german, but it probably works similarly in germany how does the german government know who to send the ballots to? they are sent to everyone who is eligible for voting here - which is all citizens that are 18 years old. how often are censuses conducted? how does the government take into account recent moves, or people who have recently come of voting age? there are no censuses in sweden. they are unnecessary here. sweden has a national register of all its inhabitants which is always kept updated. it has a registered address for everyone - children will be registered at their parents' address and homeless people will typically have a registered address at for example a church or a municipal office. when you move, you must notify the government of your new address. it is in fact illegal to not do so. and it is in your own best interest to update your registered address - besides the ability to get mail, being registered at the wrong address will interfere with social services and many other things. when you change your address, mail destined for your old address will be forwarded to your new address for a period of time. because of this, none of the things you mentioned are problems in sweden.

- we signed up for disney a couple of weeks ago and my son and i raced through mandalorian in a few days. now with schools shutting down for the foreseeable future he will much more time at home and i wanted advice of what star wars series he should watch next. he is 11 years old and has seen the original trilogy and the sequel trilogy, but not the prequels. any suggestions on which of the other series he should watch first, or should i inflict the prequel trilogy on him first?

- guillotine will come in handy when you fight one of the act 8 bosses can't remember which one but her r3 ends the last phase in 1 shot, otherwise you have to hit him her a crapload of times.

- at the end of the game, if you choose a path that leads to the matrix, they say that v's body is too much johnny for v to live. you can choose to either let johnny keep the body and live a long life or keep your body and die shortly because it will see you as a foreign body. i have 2 problems with this. 1 if i keep my body and die wouldn't the chip that is turning your brain into johnny just keep doing its thing. it seems that as it follows its programming it would repair your body by removing the remaining v parts and continuing to create another construct of johnny. meaning either way he lives on in your body? and the one that really bothers me. 2 why can't you load the v construct on the chip that is in your brain? it obviously functions well enough and you always have someone standing right there who could slot the chip into mokishi download your construct onto it and jam it back in your head. wouldn't this cause the chip to turn your brain back into a v construct allowing v to live as long as johnny would?

- hello! i am seeking to run a one shot at 11 30 am gmt 2 1pm gmt 2 of the walking dead rpg, it's called the second incident and was inspired by the dyatlov pass incident. the game takes place in the nenets autonomous ogruk in russia in the december of 2010, and you will take control of one of 5 player characters as they go to investigate a mysterious mountain pass. i accept 3-5 player slots! and if this goes well, i may run the wolves' den or even a custom campaign next! dm me or send a message here if interested.

- my partner decided to make the best mother s day gift this ichthyologist could ask for; a portrait of my favorite guppy ! she s so round and silly, and i love my grape of a gup!

- ahahha amazing! i think i took this around 2016 no worries on the typo, sometimes auto correct is.

- someone in my family did me the exact way over the lv spring collection - nautical neverfull mm bag with the gold chain design on it. wear your bag proudly! if someone assumes it s fake who cares. you know it s the real deal girly! that damn purse is over 2k and i he dammed if i don t flaunt it all because people never seen it and they will think it s fake!

- the fact that you haven't witnessed an obvious injury doesn't mean injuries to animals aren't common. they are. it's inconceivable that there aren't at least minor injuries to animals at every rodeo.

- because i'm lazy, i'd prefer a more expensive cube that performs well out of the box or with very little lube over time. the professionally set up cubes have at least a couple different lubes and you'd have to keep the cube feeling that way .

- wore my hanshin jersey the morning after they clinched the central league last year. rush hour in sannomiya kobe. took some pics with the digital signage at hanshin station celebrating the championship. got some strange looks from folks though . more than i do on most days even.

- you are lying. the vr editor was removed from the unturned 3.0 free to play game over 2 years ago! this item can only be obtained by playing either tilt brush by google or job simulator by.

- it could be a blood blister because i play alot of sports but i cant remember ever getting hurt there and its been there for maybe a month? more possibly.

- nice. this is what i run except i prefer shards over bb.

- all she really has to do is keep it policy related and he llook like a fool. ask him how he s going to address the border in great detail. he wont be able to do it. ask him how he s going to help americans with his tax plans in detail. he won t be able to do it. if she stays away from the insult matches and dick measuring contests then she should beat him handily.

- he can still grow, just slowly. if he plays well and gets plenty of games this season then dynamic potential will kick in and he should be able to improve again next season. but it might only boost his potential by 3 or so. still, 18 isn t too bad for this.

- all that does is reduce the resale value. if your coins get stolen, it's unlikely that you'll see them again anyway.

- marshmallows originally did come from the marsh mallow. the root was cut into small pieces, usually boiled, then soaked in honey. marshmallows were used for treating sore throats. a french entrepreneur decided to recreate them, but could not get the root, so they used basically what was a meringue instead. the sugar based marshmallows were cheaper, how most europeans were introduced to the 'food', and easier to make, store, and ship, so they became the default version. i want to make the original version some year,hence all the research, but have not had luck growing the marsh mallow.

- it's not a software update but a server switch update to all devices, however, the full ui is only available on select countries where google has reached agreements with content providers.

- i haven't seen season 4 yet and thought season 3 fell pretty flat, you're going to hate season 4 then.

- many bridges on the way to odessa from romania were destroyed. access is difficult and the area is on high alert, there is a curfew for car transportation. there is many channels on telegram with updates, so you can be up to date to any changes on the area. it is possible but you need to be extremely careful, the army doesn't want civilians around too much.

- people really love to over exaggerate how dated megaman legends' actually is. the controls are not the best, but they're not terribly hard to wrap your head around and they certainly are not tank controls. you use the d-pad to move megaman and the l1 r1 buttons to rotate the camera left and right. the game was designed around these controls so you don't have to worry about looking up and down too much. x is jump, square is shoot, triangle is special weapon, and o is interact. the game has two forms of lock on. the first and one you use the most is the soft-lock which works by just keeping the camera facing whatever you want to shoot and megaman will just shoot at it. the other lock on is a hard-lock which you use by holding down r2. while using it you can't move and the camera tracks the enemy you lock on too. you don't use this a lot, so don't worry about it too much. legends 1 can absolutely be recommended in good conscious. just give whoever your recommending it to a heads up about the lack of analog control and they should be fine. also, this is a problem exclusive to legends 1 since legends 2 does have traditional analog control as well as a traditional lock-on.

- you can stack up scorched stacks very quickly to trigger multiple ignitions on a single beefy target, which is fun.

- i'm swedish and not german, but it probably works similarly in germany how does the german government know who to send the ballots to? they are sent to everyone who is eligible for voting here - which is all citizens that are 18 years old. how often are censuses conducted? how does the government take into account recent moves, or people who have recently come of voting age? there are no censuses in sweden. they are unnecessary here. sweden has a national register of all its inhabitants which is always kept updated. it has a registered address for everyone - children will be registered at their parents' address and homeless people will typically have a registered address at for example a church or a municipal office. when you move, you must notify the government of your new address. it is in fact illegal to not do so. and it is in your own best interest to update your registered address - besides the ability to get mail, being registered at the wrong address will interfere with social services and many other things. when you change your address, mail destined for your old address will be forwarded to your new address for a period of time. because of this, none of the things you mentioned are problems in sweden.

Let me get back to the conversation. I was in the middle of a discussion when I got lost in my own thoughts and ended up here, where the conversation just didn't align with what I wanted to say. It's like this one guy said something that resonated with me, but I couldn't find the right words to respond. Sometimes it feels like we're all on the same page, yet our paths are never quite aligned. That's why I'm drawn to certain people - they understand my struggles, even when I don't know how to explain them.

In this moment, what resonates with me is that feeling of being stuck in a perpetual state of flux. It's like my thoughts are constantly revolving around the same topics, yet nothing seems to change. I'm seeking an answer, or maybe it's just a signpost pointing out the way ahead - anything to give me direction.

- after hearing from the other posters, i've decided to do my best at whatever level my dkgs happen to be at which should generally be decent, given that i invested in those same ranked cups last year and there's been a year of incidental level ups , but mostly save the level-boost tickets for the ranked weeks where i have something i want to earn. for this week with two days left, i'm currently sitting in 5th, but not in such a solid spot where i couldn't be overtaken. 4th is doable, and 3rd would be a stretch assuming my opponents don't increase from where they currently are .

I've been feeling like I'm stuck in this perpetual state of limbo, where I'm constantly torn between two opposing forces. It's as if I'm caught in this viscous cycle where everything seems to be interconnected, yet nothing is ever fully resolved. The more I try to pinpoint the source of my malaise, the more it seems to elude me. At times, it feels like a futile exercise in self-reflection - as if I'm staring into the abyss, only to find myself staring back. What's needed is a spark that sets everything into motion; an event that breaks this inertia and propels me forward. Until then, I'll be stuck here, wandering through life like a lost wanderer.

- when you arrive to complete the quoted work and the client has a few other things to do? for example, i just had an 800 punch list full day job and the client also wanted a door stop and towel holder installed, plus a closet door put back on its tracks when i arrived. in total, these 3 add ons took maybe 15 minutes and i did not charge any extra. of course, none of them required materials, but i m wondering how you guys usually navigate this.

- i don't think the crinkled crispy dried up leaves will prop. if they have been laying in the pot, they would have propped by now. you want those green plump ones near the bottom or top for a successful propagation. if you decide to behead the big one, you can pluck a few off the cutting, you will need some stem for the new plant. beheading will also help with the stretching it had done. umm, i'm not sure on how to get the trunk to grow width. maybe some can chime in and offer some advice. but i'm sure if you behead and take the new plant and give it more light, it's trunk will get fatter.

- that was bogus. well the whole bill is bogus. i was just reading an article about the springfield rep and day talking about how there concerned about illegal guns coming into the state via 89 and 90 . but they want to make it difficult on us . i hope the ammo purchases is gone because we know what they want it for.

- so i'm kinda waiting in line, and i'm wondering what you all doing. by the way, love you all cones!

- last night i spent about an hour watching a movie on viaplay netflix equivalent and i did not experience any extreme heat at all. a hit warm, but within what i'd call normal temperatures.

Answer:

I'm just stuck in this perpetual state of limbo, where I'm unable to find the energy to do anything. It's like my mind is a never-ending construction site, with thoughts and emotions constantly building and rebuilding themselves into an unrecognizable mess. The days feel like they're blending together, and before I know it, I'm stuck in some sort of Groundhog Day situation. Sometimes I wonder if this is just the price we pay for having a creative mind, but I guess that's just me trying to make sense of my own world.",200,0.8,0.95,40,1.1,0,0,['</s>'],Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct.IQ1_S.gguf

- i absolutely don't hate the song, but it's one of my not so favorites. much like other more popular tunes like rehab and love is a losing game. it played on my pandora and i sang every word in my head, but it doesn't touch me the same way so many of her other less popular ones do.

- happiness is up there. the way the melody builds as the emotions of the story being told pile up is so well done. the great gatsby references are kind of a mixed bag for me, though. they only really make sense if you don't actually know anything about the novel's themes or ending. it's a weird move from taylor, who's generally very intentional with her metaphors and references.

I'm finding myself increasingly drawn to melodies that evoke a somber, yet calming atmosphere. It's as if my mind has become attuned to the rhythms of pain, and I'm seeking solace in the harmonies that resonate with my own discomfort. There's an unexplainable comfort in knowing that someone else out there shares this same sentiment - it's as if we're all silently nodding in agreement, acknowledging the existence of this peculiar affinity.",200,0.8,0.95,40,1.1,0,0,['</s>'],Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct.IQ1_S.gguf

- last 10-20 yrs has seen constant growth and investment in the province. negative migration was from pre 2008.

- yea before us it was military mostly navy and weirdos. now it s weird to not have at least one. out of my friend group that i ve been friends with since high school only one of us has none.

- i did. i tried to call tsa but it s all automated, and i came here to see if other people have flown without an id.

- we had a code for productive non-chargeable hours . you don t want to over charge a project because you may throw the budget out of whack. then on the next project bid they over estimate and lose out on the project.

- that s so outrageous when you actually say it like that lol. for profit home owners insurance in fl makes no sense. just none. it s going to be like that in the mid west soon with how powerful those hail storms and tornadoes are becoming as well. just make a very basic federally subsidized homeowners insurance plan like the fema flood insurance plan and put a cap on it. that would solve like 70 percent of the states issues and it would leave the coas and south fl hjomes dealing with private insurance or state ran insurance. at this point i can t blame for profit insurance for the rate hikes because this state is disaster prone. miami was flooded from a basic thunder storm this year lol. just imagine if a cat 3 hits it.

- the pacers are currently 40-31 and 6th place in the eastern conference with 11 games remaining, a top 6 seed is what we want, but the 4th seed would be excellent as well as we would get home court advantage for a round, the 5th seed is the seed we would want to avoid the most because we would not get home court advantage and our 2nd round matchup would be against the celtics. so what does this mean, do we root for the teams ahead of us to win and just hope the heat and 76ers lose, or do we root for the magic and or knicks to start losing games to give us a shot at a 4 seed, possibly a 5 seed hopefully not ? tricky situation. pacers remaining schedule lakers clippers bulls vs lakers vs nets nets vs thunder vs heat raptors cavaliers vs hawks heat remaining schedule vs cavaliers vs warriors vs trailblazers wizards vs knicks vs 76ers rockets pacers hawks vs mavericks vs raptors vs raptors 76ers remaining schedule clippers kings vs clippers cavaliers raptors vs thunder heat grizzlies spurs vs pistons vs magic vs nets.

- actually, sea otters are cooler, at least externally, since the sea tends to have much lower temperatures than most rivers. not sure about internal body temperature, but it's probably the same.

- even weirder then how you care so much about american politics, ever think about getting a hobby?

- lakers, clippers, and warriors are all old. suns and pelicans are relying on their stars staying healthy to make the playoffs. jazz made the playoffs 2 years ago and people are acting like they're some team that been bad for 10 years. if we put a decent team together today and stoped tanking, we'd be competing for a play-in spot at minimum.

- they get to decide what it means now ? they have their own ideas about it, yes, but the audience cannot decide what a work of art means. let's say you write a satirical play on certain political events. how can an audience decide that this is no longer what the play means?

- i feel like this particular show is a little overrated based on how often it comes up . it's a case of glory guitar on jerry's part, whereby rather than putting in the hard work all over the fretboard, he sometimes opted to just go for the high-register glory notes. to me, the payoffs weren't as satisfying when they felt a little unearned. anyway, not a bad show, but not quite up to the level of red rocks, starlight or alpine from earlier in the tour.

- hi, newbie here, i've attempted to play the game a couple of times over the last year but can't seem to get past the first 1-2 hours of gameplay without getting overwhelmed and quitting, i feel like i'm definitely doing something wrong because this is the kind of game i tend to gravitate towards. any tips on getting started the right way?

- would narrow pads work on these mt200 calipers? i assumed there was a limitation when it comes to that. i saw that pads have different shapes and assumed only one type fits each caliper correctly.

- it s interesting about wang yibo. prior to watching the untamed, i d seen a lot of clips of him from street dance of china, and he was definitely the cool guy. not completely unlike wangji but different. when i first saw him in costume, it totally threw me off but as i got into the show, i definitely started to appreciate his beauty. i feel like this is just about the most romantic cdrama out there. the longing looks are ridiculous. i cannot imagine anyone thinking this is a bromance!

- yes i love the departed. and i m not saying black panther doesn t have thematic elements. i just didn t connect with the characters. it s a personal preference i suppose. i do think there is something to be said about serious cinema being represented by the oscars.

- hi! im currently developing and hopefully soon releasing my first game. i know how crucial marketing is to the success of the game so i started doing some social media stuff, i made yt channel where i will be posting trailers and updates. i also made twitter account mainly to post more frequent updates and funny game related stuff. my question is how to spread word about my game, im afraid that twitter game will be too slow and grinding to some decent followers amount will take too long. what can i do to promote my game brand? btw i also have my website that looks like typical game dev page yt trailer twitter.

- sounds like nick. he never finished at u of w from what i remember hearing. must have been too busy eating and harassing women. ever see that story of him and a woman who was not his wife breaking into a closed kelseys at 2am.lol. he's a gem forsure!

- i definitely resonate more on the right, but i ve lived in california my whole life. everything that i know is here, and i felt like i wanted to help protect the people that i love here. i guess that s my main conflict working to serve the people that i know here in california or going to a place that would be more hospitable in terms of making enough to afford the cost of living.

- flash offer. flaired only. only have 2 ww stamps, rest us. comment below us vs ww and then pm me your address.

- makes sense, would you think it s better to buy a new racket any other choice with bigger head size instead of this?

- i missed out on the spirits in black event and didn't get the lotus spirit. when will i be able to get the lotus spirit?

- ive worked at 11 different stores and i ve never seen a monitor horizontal like that. also how did y all get it so dirty.

- it depends on the etsy seller but most should ship to australia! i do! i would search filigree claws or filigree hand piece or filigree ring set etc on there. good luck!

- yes i am from ldn! bogot feels pretty safe from my experience. no different to salvador and rio in brazil where i have spent the last month. just don t wander into unknown areas, be alert, carry little with you. taxis and uber s are really cheap for late night travel.

Here are some example comments:
- to start with, define what an older man is to you? i am looking for an age range.

- this tower was by shop architects, while 270 park was a foster and partners design. both designs were unveiled or leaked in 2018, so the resemblance is most likely a coincidence.

- take five is maybe the most famous example, being actually written in 5 4 of course.

- ill have to try that. i know the first main mission when you get to england was bug and i had to reload a save that was about 50 minutes before and then it worked.

- blast burn. but realize that blast burn is a community day move so you can't use a charge tm to learn it. you'd either have to use an elite tm to learn it or evolve into a blaziken to learn it during a special event that allows for it. based on prior history, you'll likely have the opportunity during december's community day. niantic could release it in another fashion but we don't have any information on when and if they would.

- mine personally is the one that plays a billion times a shift that says buy forever stamps because she s your forever mom . for some reason that commercial especially pisses me off.

- i feel like that must be it? or she s getting scraps from the table? i adopted a stray cat 10 years ago and he still eats like he s never gonna eat again so i would never free feed him. he also steals my other cats food after, so i make sure i m there at meals to distract him. it s really not that hard! she needs to put in more effort!

- at the end of the game, if you choose a path that leads to the matrix, they say that v's body is too much johnny for v to live. you can choose to either let johnny keep the body and live a long life or keep your body and die shortly because it will see you as a foreign body. i have 2 problems with this. 1 if i keep my body and die wouldn't the chip that is turning your brain into johnny just keep doing its thing. it seems that as it follows its programming it would repair your body by removing the remaining v parts and continuing to create another construct of johnny. meaning either way he lives on in your body? and the one that really bothers me. 2 why can't you load the v construct on the chip that is in your brain? it obviously functions well enough and you always have someone standing right there who could slot the chip into mokishi download your construct onto it and jam it back in your head. wouldn't this cause the chip to turn your brain back into a v construct allowing v to live as long as johnny would?

- oh no no its not my native language. i'm indian as much as you are, the language that i learnt or still learning out of interest or for better job opportunities is english. arabic, i'm learning to impress the girl yeah, she's and arab i love.

- what do you mean by controlling, and have other people seen them doing it before?

I've been noticing how certain individuals seem to be stuck in a perpetual state of limbo, constantly oscillating between their past and present selves. It's like they're perpetually wandering through a labyrinth of self-reflection, unable to fully grasp the essence of who they truly are. This ambiguity is what makes them so relatable - their inability to fully confront themselves is what makes them so endearingly human.

- when did you receive the email confirmation you paid for priority ? i got my payment confirmation on 11th february and still no news. bio was 26th january and still no news. everyone else has got this generic email with same bio date as me even after.

- yes, people are very busy commenting on reddit about things that waste time that they don't have to participate in.

- love these kinds of events. great team runs this particular event, this will be my 3rd kotn and i can't wait!

I've been noticing changes in myself lately, with an odd sense of detachment from reality. Suddenly, I find myself becoming overly critical and paranoid about my performance at work, even if it's just minor stuff that doesn't matter to anyone but me.

- if you are a poor college student don t spend your money on nods. there is so many other things that will pay off better in the long run. what you should do with 12-1400 in the bank right now. 1. pay off any credit card debt high interest student loans 2. start an ira buy bonds 3. put it in a high interest savings account this are all better options than buying shitty night vision. once you get out of college, start a career, and have some play money then invest in some quality nods.

- i don t mean the level ups were higher. i mean it just seemed there was less ec being dropped. i usually end with over 80,000 ec and only manage to end with less than half that. i don t even level long up to six and you usually have to level the first character to six to finish.

- yes everything will be fine! just don t finish the game or play rdr1 and everything will be perfect.

- california gold is an iherb proprietary brand which has failed third party testing in the past. i wouldn t trust them. the prices should ve been a clear warning sign.

- is it possible to back date a claim? ie, the opp was earning possibly basic rate before getting the current job?

- does anyone know where i can buy a physical copy of this for my c64?

- less play, but often much worse players and you see them laugh in your face when they beat you!

- i've been working on some alan moore comics annotations sites - and i'm a little late to the game, but just got hooked on paper girls in the last couple months. i was thinking of creating a wordpress annotations site - anyone wanna co-author?

- many bridges on the way to odessa from romania were destroyed. access is difficult and the area is on high alert, there is a curfew for car transportation. there is many channels on telegram with updates, so you can be up to date to any changes on the area. it is possible but you need to be extremely careful, the army doesn't want civilians around too much.

- it s just seo around being fee-only. there s barely any fee-only advisors in my state and it s single digit numbers in my mid-sized city.

- i'm playing a life oracle in pf2e and it's a blast. do i heal every turn? no but i also help a lot with damage mitigation and heal a bunch. most of my spell slots go towards healing and i love it.

- gender is just terms assigned to roles and behaviors. its not fake and it's not a product of capitalism its just words assigned to behaviors.

- at this point we need a free release about the size of the 30th anniversary pack that focuses exclusively on the core playlists. i know nobody wants to know gambit exists but there's no excuse for gambit to have no new maps since forsaken with still no news of getting any maps anytime soon. if it takes bungie scrapping one of their seasons and making another six-month long season for this to happen then go for it, but what is labeled both by bungie and the players as the core of the game should not be the weakest part of it every single year.

- its not about new players or old players, its about basic life skill. you're new, you dont know things, then try to read and learn. just like when you buy something for example, you have to read the instruction manual first to use it properly. the thing he asked is not even some higher level or hiding tricks, its just the passive which you could easily read even in-game.

- join turners on river road. takes care of all your concerns. have a bonfire later that evening on the riverbank and watch the belle of louisville float by.

- you are probably correct. either way they will be served justice by the spear of democracy.

- i have always found the service to be spotty in performance. whether i select the server or let eddie select what it thinks is best, the connection eventually fails, or i guess, times out. my most recent problem was with a hotel in london. i selected a server in phoenix az us and my connection completely stalled out. i've had problems in that hotel before where performance was terribly slow no matter what country or what server i selected. even if i selected a uk server. i signed up for another company and used it in the same london hotel last week and it performed perfectly. i would have never known if i hadn't turned it on myself, it worked so well.

- looking to start collecting the imp knights and i want to know what a good list looks like. the app doesn't really give me much to go on because it's just a bunch of names that mean nothing to me at this point. any advice is welcome and appreciated.

- what annoys me is when the acronym used is just wrong. for example, when someone uses dmc, the acronym that should be used to refer to the original devil may cry, to refer to the reboot, dmc devil may cry. when referring to the reboot, it should be dmc because the reboot lowercased the m whereas the original devil may cry didn't. the reverse is also true, some people refer to the original devil may cry using dmc even though the m isn't lowercase. it's small, but is good for distinquishing the two games. another, more recent example i noticed is people refering to god of war ragnarok as gow2. where'd they get the 2? there's no 2 in ragnarok's title and there's also already a god of war 2. why would you choose to use an acronym that will lead to confusion instead of using the actual acronym of the game's title, gowr. that's dumb. don't do that.

- rome and madrid are in my top 3 city tracks. they just flow so excellently well on 200cc, maybe that s why i like the city tracks as much as i do. they re all a blast on 200.

- that might help explain why the yields on all the newer listings are 3.5 max. some of the earlier ones got to almost 6 . it's possible that some of the economics of the earlier homes were set extra attractively to try to build out an initial customer base. something worth keeping an eye on.

- for sure! the game is a lot of fun, and encourages creativity with strategy. a variety of win conditions allow for completely different play styles from player to player!

- i haven't had any issues on the 3 i've used on builds for people. i really like these bcg. and for 100 bucks for nickel boron coating and a c-158 bolt is a solid price.

- i think the issue is in clear view, no nutrient export. or do you add carbon and use a skimmer?

- someone in my family did me the exact way over the lv spring collection - nautical neverfull mm bag with the gold chain design on it. wear your bag proudly! if someone assumes it s fake who cares. you know it s the real deal girly! that damn purse is over 2k and i he dammed if i don t flaunt it all because people never seen it and they will think it s fake!

- although it is somewhat watery and barely has body, a certain witbier air is noticeable due to the light background of white cereal and coriander. the herbal touch of the infused chamomile is not bad at all to camouflage the vulgar flavor and makes it refreshing.

- gotcha thank you. any specific streams in your opinion that is the closest to traditional tv?

- maybe there's a makerspace or a club in your area . doing that by hand is insane unless you got arms like kingkong.

- fraud wasn't proven, that's why they were slapped with a label. i'm assuming most of you are bag holding.

- i believe that there was a third son in the desmond family. this revealed that the donovan was the prime minister during the war. considering this is about 20 or so years out from when spy x family takes place, that puts donovan and melinda as being in their late 40s- early 50s. demetrius would have been born about 15-16 years ago when they would have been in their mid 30s to early 40s. in the context of a political marriage, that's pretty late for them to have had a family. to that end, i believe that they had a son before this from during their 20s-early 30s. what happened to this child is hard to say, but i have a feeling that this one was also killed either during the war or as a casualty of the post-war power transfers and fallout. i would also make a prediction that demetrius is aware his older sibling having existed, but not damien himself.

- blizzard is one of the companies that has long supported and benefited from allowing players to mod their games. you might argue that there have been downsides, such as the birth of competitors like league of legends which was a direct outcome of the popularity of the defense of the ancients mod for warcraft 3 , but considering how much of blizzard's strength is in adapting innovations from elsewhere and providing one of the best implementations of those innovations, i think the benefits outweigh the risks. giving independent developers the opportunity to make tools for games like hearthstone is just another way for them to attract interest in their games and discover new opportunities for improvement.

The comment I wrote is a response to a post asking about the most creative ways to name pets. Here's my response:

""I'm not sure if it's just me, but I've always been drawn to the more...unconventional names. Like, take 'Fuzzypelt' for example - that's got a certain ring to it. It's not just the sound of it, either; it's like you're describing this living thing with one name. Or maybe that's just me being weird. Either way, I've always thought pet names should be more than just 'Fluffy' or 'Buddy'. Give them a real name that's got character - like 'Sneezecloud', or 'Peltstorm' even.""

- every time wolverine is destroyed or discarded, he gets 1 power this would align with his rage ability that usually goes with him in every video game he's in. if you're able to piss him off 3 times, he ends up being a 2 6 . more fitting of one of marvel's most iconic characters.

- honestly, warlords of draenor had the most satisfying leveling experience of each expansion when it was current. each zone gave you a choice of new actions to use once you'd unlocked that zone's outpost, the world treasures were all unique moments of environmental storytelling and the toys you got as a result were fantastic loot-a-rang smoothed looting from a distance even for non-engineers, the launching totem and slow-fall toys gave a new transportation option in the days before flight would be accessible, the garrison hearthstone let you mix up your personal hearthing strategy while still having a quick return to your base of operations, but most importantly wod is the expansion that introduced the flight master's whistle. with the click of a button, you were whisked away to the nearest flight master. when leveling without flying, it was magnificent. now if it seems like i'm focusing on the movement options over everything else, you might conclude that an expansion like dragonflight should be my favorite, since it gives flying just a few quests into the first zone. and that's reasonable! dragonflight might very well unseat wod for me, some day. but wod had such a perfect mix of obstacles and tools to mitigate those obstacles that i had more fun questing there than anywhere else. if you already have flying, though, all that goes out the window. then it's something like dragonflight wod mop bfa legion shadowlands cataclysm wotlk tbc.

- i believe that there was a third son in the desmond family. this revealed that the donovan was the prime minister during the war. considering this is about 20 or so years out from when spy x family takes place, that puts donovan and melinda as being in their late 40s- early 50s. demetrius would have been born about 15-16 years ago when they would have been in their mid 30s to early 40s. in the context of a political marriage, that's pretty late for them to have had a family. to that end, i believe that they had a son before this from during their 20s-early 30s. what happened to this child is hard to say, but i have a feeling that this one was also killed either during the war or as a casualty of the post-war power transfers and fallout. i would also make a prediction that demetrius is aware his older sibling having existed, but not damien himself.

- well, i had 2 weeks of vacation so i spend alof of time in it recently. i managed to do alot of side quests only need to finish the dlcs now , played quint, crafted gear etc. and got around 85 hours played if that helps you anything.

- correct but is it safe to order online? i am afraid that what if i found a problem getting the delivery?

- yeah, you can hear how much they got right in predictions. even freaking saying that parks and rec would need to completely change their format in season 2. it's pretty true. season 1 was lame and then after season 2, it grew to be this comedy powerhouse.

- i haven't flown to mlb myself because the instructors at my school all insist the controllers there are jerks. guess it's true.

- thanks very much. i'll take some more time to dig deeper into the greeks and black-scholes.

- that machine is not supposed to be used that way. anyone who uses it that way is setting themselves up for an eventual serious back injury. there are machines you can do that, but they typically have a flat deck for foot placement, and multi-level shoulder pads for forward or back facing in the machine. 270 pounds there plus the starting weight of the machine of 100. this is a forward facing machine. it even shows it on the diagram on the machine.

- to clarify, a squib won't directly cause this. a squib is a round stuck somewhere between chamber and muzzle. as others have said, it's a pop swoosh not a bang with less felt recoil. it will usually not cycle a semi-auto firearm. i've seen 1 2 a dozen in 30 years or shooting and almost as many as an instructor. saw one on a fa tommy on a form 4 once. guy almost squeezed the trigger before hearing me yell the line cold because of it. he was incredibly lucky i heard the classic swoosh from the other side of the line. if you shoot another round through a barrel that is obstructed by a squib or something else , this could happen. it could also happen if the round ignites outside of battery. surprised no one has mentioned that.

- the mere fact that you don t know this shows how limited is your information you have in this conflict. israel s occupation and racism against palestinians should not be tolerated, at the same time, the terrorist that rule palestinian and undermining the democracy should also not be tolerated. both sides are doing conflict, due to religious and ethnic nationalism.

- skymuster is trash. simples put an order in for a starlink asap as well goodluck!

- so if an employee doesn't feel valued, appreciated or welcomed.that's not cause for concern in terms of a reference? sure, my manager is a nice person. but i don't feel like my contributions are being seen by her. the other members of my team see my value but for some reason the manager doesn't see it. so i'm not sure i want a manager like that being a reference for a pool. i feel like she could sabotage me.

- too busy creating elaborate organizations and luring in mentally challenged people looking for friends, then arresting them.

- if you are a poor college student don t spend your money on nods. there is so many other things that will pay off better in the long run. what you should do with 12-1400 in the bank right now. 1. pay off any credit card debt high interest student loans 2. start an ira buy bonds 3. put it in a high interest savings account this are all better options than buying shitty night vision. once you get out of college, start a career, and have some play money then invest in some quality nods.

- the pacers are currently 40-31 and 6th place in the eastern conference with 11 games remaining, a top 6 seed is what we want, but the 4th seed would be excellent as well as we would get home court advantage for a round, the 5th seed is the seed we would want to avoid the most because we would not get home court advantage and our 2nd round matchup would be against the celtics. so what does this mean, do we root for the teams ahead of us to win and just hope the heat and 76ers lose, or do we root for the magic and or knicks to start losing games to give us a shot at a 4 seed, possibly a 5 seed hopefully not ? tricky situation. pacers remaining schedule lakers clippers bulls vs lakers vs nets nets vs thunder vs heat raptors cavaliers vs hawks heat remaining schedule vs cavaliers vs warriors vs trailblazers wizards vs knicks vs 76ers rockets pacers hawks vs mavericks vs raptors vs raptors 76ers remaining schedule clippers kings vs clippers cavaliers raptors vs thunder heat grizzlies spurs vs pistons vs magic vs nets.

- i'm not really a windows user now switched to linux for various reasons i dual boot it still for some programs like the adobe suite but rarely use it but i used to use it as my main for years and the reason i didn't buy mac was because it was out of my price range and 2 or 3 apps i used didn't work there although there were very good alternative apps there i am too lazy and ofc new mac hardware is top notch so if i had the money i'd probably buy one. but as to why they chose windows these are most probably the reasons half the people would give.

- blizzard is one of the companies that has long supported and benefited from allowing players to mod their games. you might argue that there have been downsides, such as the birth of competitors like league of legends which was a direct outcome of the popularity of the defense of the ancients mod for warcraft 3 , but considering how much of blizzard's strength is in adapting innovations from elsewhere and providing one of the best implementations of those innovations, i think the benefits outweigh the risks. giving independent developers the opportunity to make tools for games like hearthstone is just another way for them to attract interest in their games and discover new opportunities for improvement.

- remember to vote for jon ossoff and raphael warnock, if you want -marijuana to be decriminalized and or legalized at the federal level - 15 federal minimum wage -climate change to be taken seriously -increased access to healthcare and coverage for predicting conditions -racial and criminal justice reform -mitch mcconnell to not be the senate leader anymore did i mentioned marijuana decriminalized and or legalized at the federal level? there s a bill that the house just passed earlier this month that s just sitting on mitch mcconnell s desk that, if the senate voted on and passed, would decriminalize marijuana on the national scale, which would open the doors for georgia to legally sell it recreationally and put those tax revenue dollars to good use in our state. if ossoff and warnock are both voted in, you have a 50 50 split in the senate, which means republicans and thus mitch mcconnell wouldn t be in control of the senate and what bills are voted on. mitch is not going to vote on this major, historical legislation, but with a 50 50 split, the vp soon to be kamala harris , would be the floor leader and the tie-breaking vote, if necessary. if you enjoy marijuana, or at least believe in other peoples rights to enjoy it casually just like alcohol, and or any of the other above listed important issues, please please please vote for jon ossoff and raphael warnock in this senate runoff election!

- hi i know that docker doesn t work on m1 macs yet insider preview aside . but is there a way to run the cli and use docker context to point to another server i have docker running on?

- i do this now! i help anywhere i can typically! i'm actually a carpenter business owner, and always help out veterans and good folks for pennies on the dollar. everyone is struggling, good to help when you can. you're correct of the support also, he's in good hands with his grandma and grandpa and whatnot, i on the other hand am by myself in this world! need to look out for that first and foremost.

- they are pretty much out of stock everywhere. i bought a 128 one for 530 due to price inflation.

- what annoys me is when the acronym used is just wrong. for example, when someone uses dmc, the acronym that should be used to refer to the original devil may cry, to refer to the reboot, dmc devil may cry. when referring to the reboot, it should be dmc because the reboot lowercased the m whereas the original devil may cry didn't. the reverse is also true, some people refer to the original devil may cry using dmc even though the m isn't lowercase. it's small, but is good for distinquishing the two games. another, more recent example i noticed is people refering to god of war ragnarok as gow2. where'd they get the 2? there's no 2 in ragnarok's title and there's also already a god of war 2. why would you choose to use an acronym that will lead to confusion instead of using the actual acronym of the game's title, gowr. that's dumb. don't do that.

- not surprised, they are brainwashed to believe all the bad that has happened to them is caused by jews. the truth is very different.

- i deleted that app because they fucked me on a promo but i feel like the unders hit way more than the overs. that being said nice hit!

- honestly this just screams she s insanely jealous of her sister. strangers on the internet had to point out that her sister was being abused and she still made excuses.

- sound feedback lg don t mind it, a little loud perhaps. pncr sounds like a wet fart, no punch grenade launcher punchy! but loud.

- my criteria is a combination of screentime characterization wins for example, the nightwing in tt had a very small screentime but had great characterization and never had a terrible moment. meanwhile dcamu nightwing had loads of screentime, great characterization but had more ls than wins.

- my son, who now has a ph.d in music composition, went through the tj advanced musical program, which is i think what this was 20 years ago. it is what absolutely enabled him to get him free rides through his doctorate. if this is anything like that, go for it. he now heads up a large youth musical organization, performs live regularly, and has had his compositions performed gobally.

- super interesting giving some camera time and credited name to justin gaethje. wonder how actively the ufc is pursuing him.

- gonna be honest, i m not super enamoured by sean payton. he had quite a few mediocre at best seasons with drew brees as his quarterback and even though they re both short, they re wildly different and i m not sure that what payton typically does is a great fit for russ we kinda just saw that with hackett. not to mention if he wants to bring in his own gm, i m not sure no is the front office i want to be poaching from. the narrative is that he and harbaugh are 1a and 1b but, imo, it s a pretty clear 1 and 2. not saying he s necessarily a bad hire but i think the name and the clout of sean payton are a little beyond the tangible results. to me harbaugh s results and football philosophy seem much better aligned with what this team needs, especially for russ to succeed.

I've been noticing myself getting really worked up over small stuff recently. I'll get irked at things that shouldn't even register on my radar, like when some stranger makes an innocent comment or when someone's just not doing their job right. It's like this little voice in the back of my head would pipe up and say ""you're a failure"" or ""this is all your fault"". And then I'd get all riled up, thinking I'm the only one who truly matters here. It's strange, because sometimes I'll catch myself wondering what's wrong with me, but other times it feels like everything just clicks into place and I feel like I can finally breathe again.

- new alpha shield sounds fun to use, is it worth it for a solitude ship build? or is it better for moving in packs so it comes off cooldown more often?

- i have recently seen a few trailers where gunshots are timed with the music. i hate it, because it makes the act of shooting so meaningless and trivial.

- work more fiber into your diet. chia seeds, oatmeal and tons of popcorn does it for me so when you go, it all goes ; coffee helps you go to the bathroom, but the lack of fiber is most likely why your stools aren t solid. cut back on oils to and drink tons of water .this is coming from someone with a classic case of jewish inherited ibs - have been to several doctors including gastroenterologists and refuse to take a medicine to cure what should be happening in all of our bodies naturally short of those with ibd s it s 100 diet related you don t need to introduce additional chemicals into your body, yes they work, but i prefer solving the issue rather than just throwing something at it to temporarily suppress it.

- you are probably correct. either way they will be served justice by the spear of democracy.

- is anyone else just glad that we re now allowed to end sentences with a preposition?

- im working a similar position right now and thats pretty close to what we get. translates to about 25 an hour low end, and then when you get promoted to senior usually after meeting fairly high monthly marks you get boosted to that higher 75k pay raise plus commissions.

- hahah i thought about deleting it yes but i believe it doesn't matter if 5 others try it. a better entrepreneur would also be able to copy me starting 2 months after me. but i wont leave it online for too long d.

- out of curiosity, and since i don't follow football at all, why isn't messi as marketable as ronaldo? is he more private? more of an introvert? less interest in sponsorships?

- i do this now! i help anywhere i can typically! i'm actually a carpenter business owner, and always help out veterans and good folks for pennies on the dollar. everyone is struggling, good to help when you can. you're correct of the support also, he's in good hands with his grandma and grandpa and whatnot, i on the other hand am by myself in this world! need to look out for that first and foremost.

- unfortunately that s the modern gamer apparently lol and idk maybe but i think it s unfair to judge it on a couple shorts as a we got gog at home lol plus the star child drax short was pretty funny. but they has like dozens of shorts i doubt they re all leaning in that direction.

- i absolutely don't hate the song, but it's one of my not so favorites. much like other more popular tunes like rehab and love is a losing game. it played on my pandora and i sang every word in my head, but it doesn't touch me the same way so many of her other less popular ones do.

- oh for sure. id replace the rubber band in the gi joes. i would play with them in the lake so the rubber bands would deteriorate quick.

- really is there a difference between game modes? i always thought it was the same, but i do struggle a lot more in ones for a better rank.

""I've always been drawn to people who are unapologetically themselves, even when their choices might be seen as unconventional. Like, I've met folks who are so rigid in their lifestyle, yet they're not fazed by societal expectations. It's almost...enviable.""

You can't help but notice the way some individuals carry themselves. They're not held back by what others think of them. There's this freedom to it that's hard to put into words.

I've seen people who were given a certain label and they've managed to thrive despite it. Their character doesn't get altered, even when there are parts about themselves that might be perceived as broken.

It's like...the way they carry themselves is unshaken. They're not trying to prove anything to anyone. It's hard to put my finger on it. But I think the freedom to it - the liberty they embody - it's something I've always admired",200,0.8,0.95,40,1.1,0,0,['</s>'],Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct.IQ1_S.gguf

- i agree with maverick. figure out what kind of sorceress your friend is going to be playing, and try to use a different damage type. also, a sorceress is pretty squishy, so something that can absorb some damage would be useful. if you are the type of player that likes to whack at enemies one by one, a zeal paladin or barbarian can be fun. if you prefer casters, wind druids can be strong with basic equipment and have pretty beefy summons.

This comment is going to be a bit of a challenge because I'm having a bit of a crisis lately. I've been stuck in this weird limbo where nothing seems to really matter and everything feels like an effort. Even the smallest tasks feel like climbing a mountain, and my brain's just not cooperating. It's like I'm constantly wandering through a fog, never finding anything that truly resonates with me. And don't even get me started on socializing - it's been a real struggle to connect with people lately, I just can't seem to find the right words to say.",200,0.8,0.95,40,1.1,0,0,['</s>'],Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct.IQ1_S.gguf

- it definitely is. best sustain roaming super in the game, has excellent ability to stagger enemies and is excellent at getting in and out of dangerous positions.

- damn, i'd buy 20 of them for that. can you link the store, i wonder if they'll ship internationally.

- beyond an idiot, especially taking the religion into consideration, and his particular views and motivations. that being said, has zero bearing on the academic prowess of the university or it's students. i'm sure many that attend are not religious zealots or the dumber of people, it's more culture for many american christians than anything else.

- i also sold my bag of algo but for slightly different reasons. i only had a very small bag to begin with anyway and i was considering it as part of my downsized portfolio but it didn't make the cut at the end of the day. i have nothing against it and i think it's a great project but i suppose what tipped the balance at the end of the day was that i'd missed the sign up for the next governance period. i was really interested in it and wanted to take part but equally i wanted to rebalance my portfolio to include more coins that i could stake with and wasn't willing to wait around for algo. i'd like to pick it up again down theine if the price doesn't take off before i get there but right now i have other priorities.

- i played stony silence and i think in his entire deck he had no was to remove it.

- hey kevin! big fan. what's one type project outside of marvel you'd really want the opportunity to work on? thank you!

- i don t mean the level ups were higher. i mean it just seemed there was less ec being dropped. i usually end with over 80,000 ec and only manage to end with less than half that. i don t even level long up to six and you usually have to level the first character to six to finish.

- nta. is there a sub for entitled siblings? that s just ridiculous. the financial stuff is valid but even if they re millionaires they shouldn t expect you to take a kid on a romantic holiday.

- la sometimes gets it. houston only seems to get it for travis shoes. miami never gets it, which sucks, because that s where i m right near.

- if products don't help, maybe it's got something to do with your diet. avoid eating oily foods, avoid drinking high fat milk, meats, too much sugar or egg yolks. try cucumber and salads with high water content. try this eating routine for a few weeks, and if it doesn't help, try a dermatologist.

- do we know how michael and harry met? he is introduced in the third book but they already have a working relationship at that point. i've always assumed he was one of the allies harry mentions not being able to call in during storm front. is there any info out there about them meeting? michael's reaction at first meeting harry on the job is probably amusing enough to explore.

- it took me a while, once it clicked tho, it became super easy. at the risk of repeating others, i'll tell you what i do. when they're running around follow them. try to find a pattern in their movement. stop before they do so that you're not moving when they're stopped. then wait for them to get close enough that they start their up and down movement. once they do, they won't stop until you either got the approach message or scared them off. so take a moment and time it. for example, the crocodiles, sit up then look to your left, then right then left again, then they crouch down. if you start to move just before the crouch and stop right away, you actually gain like half a second. doesn't seem like much, but that's like 2 full running steps for your character. but if you're still moving when they start to sit up again, they run off. it's timing, and until you get it, it's super frustrating, took my fiancee a while to get it and she had to watch me do it a few times first. now she's a master. you can do it. i believe in you. now go feed those raccoons and crocs. the poor little things are starving.

- for me both are foreign languages, so i naturally watched it in japanese first. to me those are the original sounds of the characters. the english dub to me sounds equally weird as when i'm seeing a spanish or german dub of a famous hollywood actor. it doesn't matter how good they are supposed to be, they just sound wrong. but also, you do still hear their voices when you have the subtitles, don't you? i'd say the voices have personality and convey the message. but most importantly, you know what they are saying because the subtitles are there.

- i noticed some color to the left of my screen just pass my bezel this morning. at first i thought it was just the reflection from the screen but after looking closer i think it's the glass separating from the phone. you can see from the pictures i can fit some paper in between the bezel and glass and you can see some red to the left of the screen in the other picture. has anyone else noticed this or is this normal?

- i believe that there was a third son in the desmond family. this revealed that the donovan was the prime minister during the war. considering this is about 20 or so years out from when spy x family takes place, that puts donovan and melinda as being in their late 40s- early 50s. demetrius would have been born about 15-16 years ago when they would have been in their mid 30s to early 40s. in the context of a political marriage, that's pretty late for them to have had a family. to that end, i believe that they had a son before this from during their 20s-early 30s. what happened to this child is hard to say, but i have a feeling that this one was also killed either during the war or as a casualty of the post-war power transfers and fallout. i would also make a prediction that demetrius is aware his older sibling having existed, but not damien himself.

- there are a ton of posts of people loving their vehicles, so i m not discounting that. but there is a normalization around having significant issues by the fan boy contingent here that is alarming. any car forum will have complaints, but i ve never witnessed anything like this when referring to a vehicle at this price point. in years of owning high end cars, aside from jaguars in the 90 s, i ve never seen issues of this magnitude. while i know many people are quite happy, and to be clear i desperately want to be one of them, the amount of basic functional issues is alarming. i m not going to complain about minor door panel issues, but a car being able to get you from point a to b is fundamental, and i don t think this concern should be discounted. rivian is doing an excellent job of providing a highly appealing product and i want nothing more than to see them succeed. but with the issues seen here, and length of time it takes for people to often get them fixed because of service center issues, leadership should understand there are potential customers sitting on the sidelines.

- cause aiming with a gunner weapon has always been the same button. there's no reason to change it just because of wirebugs.

- could be a price increase app update . app updates will almost always hit android before apple because apple's review process takes longer. maybe check again in a couple days?

- maybe there's a makerspace or a club in your area . doing that by hand is insane unless you got arms like kingkong.

- cannibal anyone? i know where the budget lies but man wouldn't that be fun!

- like, sir, do you play crossout with mouse and keyboard? if not, then we are using completely different devices to interact with this game, how can we discuss details about aiming and driving? you keep picking on my word choices, promoting yourself, and now talking about this, at here, a game forum, how can you reply so much without talking about the game design itself? this is truly amazing, like in my opinion, when a person complains about hover being op, you should prove that hover is not op. but you are messing around with all those meaningless stuff. what's even funnier is that you keep talking about how good you are and you keep winning with hovers but hover is not op, in your interesting mindset, can i call you movement elitism ?

- i know theres the discord but for some reason i never get the notification, discord be weird like that sometimes.

- maybe there will be a future mass effect just for this plothole. mass effect the illusive slimness.

- i m going to try and acclimatize it to the winter. i m going to put it in our unheated shed for the first few winters. then i ll put it in the ground.

Over the years, it's affected how I engage with people and things – my responses are delayed, my thoughts get jumbled, and I end up feeling like I'm stuck in some perpetual state of alertness.

- that s so outrageous when you actually say it like that lol. for profit home owners insurance in fl makes no sense. just none. it s going to be like that in the mid west soon with how powerful those hail storms and tornadoes are becoming as well. just make a very basic federally subsidized homeowners insurance plan like the fema flood insurance plan and put a cap on it. that would solve like 70 percent of the states issues and it would leave the coas and south fl hjomes dealing with private insurance or state ran insurance. at this point i can t blame for profit insurance for the rate hikes because this state is disaster prone. miami was flooded from a basic thunder storm this year lol. just imagine if a cat 3 hits it.

- ftx is not at risk. they're different companies and don't share any assets between them, they both have different objectives.

- have you done any sleep tracking? some people will never be morning people but i would start with finding out if you re actually getting restful sleep with the appropriate amounts of deep and rem sleep. from there you can figure out if you need to optimize your sleep routine.

- new player upgrading camp but ran out of wood timber all 4 wood types. have stone and wild grass 250k .

- you can only put so many clothes on when it's cold, but when it's hot you can just hang in your underwear .

- thanks, i really am! usually pretty lackluster on the stuff i do but this one is top notch for me. and to think i m supposed to sell it.

- i definitely resonate more on the right, but i ve lived in california my whole life. everything that i know is here, and i felt like i wanted to help protect the people that i love here. i guess that s my main conflict working to serve the people that i know here in california or going to a place that would be more hospitable in terms of making enough to afford the cost of living.

- well from the wiki the poor man's rose had bloomed 10 times over in more than 250 countries, taking away the lives of 5,120,000 people. when its usage at an unnamed capital during a terrorist attack caused 110,000 deaths, an international treaty was established to forbid further production. however, more than 80 of the countries that possess the bomb did not dispose of or ban the use of the pre-existing bombs. currently, hundreds of thousands of miniature roses remain this was all in a lore dump after meruem gets nuked i believe.

- i actually would do that deal but like i told someone else- they probably would ve wanted atleast 2 of our unprotected picks. not sure if it s worth it for a role player.

- how's the gwp? i started the p1 last night, not sure if i'll keep the gwp or throw it on ebay.

- i do not know, for me the only reason to play on a console would be money, but even then i would not as considering the decades of catalog, the fact that you do not need a 4090, etc. it makes no sense. if that's the case probably a remaster for console it would have a market as pretty much today's kingdom come looks like a newly released game on pc.

- i'm getting to a skill level where the models need shaping at the end. i'm wondering if there is any advantage or disadvantage to shaping with mc. i'm using tissue paper backed tracing paper. my thoughts are that the mc is going to have a stronger hold then just the water? i'm not sure if this is no different than plain water so i figured i'd ask. what does the reddit have to say on my thoughts?

- i don't think the crinkled crispy dried up leaves will prop. if they have been laying in the pot, they would have propped by now. you want those green plump ones near the bottom or top for a successful propagation. if you decide to behead the big one, you can pluck a few off the cutting, you will need some stem for the new plant. beheading will also help with the stretching it had done. umm, i'm not sure on how to get the trunk to grow width. maybe some can chime in and offer some advice. but i'm sure if you behead and take the new plant and give it more light, it's trunk will get fatter.

- is anyone else just glad that we re now allowed to end sentences with a preposition?

- i need a raise but i don t see that happening i love what i do but i also think i m being taken for granted.

- gretchen wieners come up in my feed as queen bee when i was looking for her most memorable scenes with that chorus she should be.

- my dad always honked at runners and waved. probably still does. he's a fitness freak at the ripe age of 78, and believes he's giving encouragement.

- have you done any sleep tracking? some people will never be morning people but i would start with finding out if you re actually getting restful sleep with the appropriate amounts of deep and rem sleep. from there you can figure out if you need to optimize your sleep routine.

- it makes sense and it's an excellent trick, that i will surely and shamelessly steal. but i'm not sure it will work in my case i have 9 point types with possible values in multiple of 25 and up to 5000.in hindsight, i may have a complicated point system.

- i added a section of aluminum extrusion powertec maybe to my fence. i drilled a couple of holes through the fence and use some bolts and wing nuts to hold it in place. it s 36 long, 3 tall. when i m ripping longer pieces i bolt a small piece to bottom way out on the i feed end. this helps support the end of the work on the infeed side, plus i have more fence to reference against. full disclosure - i haven t used it to break down a full sheet. about a quarter panel is the largest i ve done and this solution handled it easily.

- this happens to me with pretty much every wall piece and not just windows. i m assuming it ll be fixed in the next patch.

- more excited for this then any previous season. don't think i mind not doing a boring seasonal quest and having a side mechanic i barely interact with beyond initial build set ups.

- you are lying. the vr editor was removed from the unturned 3.0 free to play game over 2 years ago! this item can only be obtained by playing either tilt brush by google or job simulator by.

- ill have to try that. i know the first main mission when you get to england was bug and i had to reload a save that was about 50 minutes before and then it worked.

- the plunge kill from the top of the chapel is just too satisfying. can't help it.

- glad this was not just me. and keeping up with the cardassians would have been an amazing spin off even though you correctly stated that this is what ds9 essentially was.

- all we can tell you is that s a sativa leaning hybrid. you know it has sativa because of the thin pointy leaves. you know it has some indica because the nodes are close together and she has that dense bushy flower structure that indica brings to the table. looks nice!

- record labels was very powerful back then, and gelb was an excellent record producer and manager.

- yeah, you can hear how much they got right in predictions. even freaking saying that parks and rec would need to completely change their format in season 2. it's pretty true. season 1 was lame and then after season 2, it grew to be this comedy powerhouse.

- i've recently dropped elvui since i currently have to play on an older laptop and trying to squeeze out as much performance as possible. one thing that i really miss though is the way elvui shows how many people needs greed's passes on loot in groups right on the loot alert without having to look at chat. i've tried looking for a standalone addon to do this, but no luck so far.

- damn that really sucks! i chatted with a rep online and asked. then when i mentioned it at the counter he added it without hesitation. so sorry to hear that.

- people really love to over exaggerate how dated megaman legends' actually is. the controls are not the best, but they're not terribly hard to wrap your head around and they certainly are not tank controls. you use the d-pad to move megaman and the l1 r1 buttons to rotate the camera left and right. the game was designed around these controls so you don't have to worry about looking up and down too much. x is jump, square is shoot, triangle is special weapon, and o is interact. the game has two forms of lock on. the first and one you use the most is the soft-lock which works by just keeping the camera facing whatever you want to shoot and megaman will just shoot at it. the other lock on is a hard-lock which you use by holding down r2. while using it you can't move and the camera tracks the enemy you lock on too. you don't use this a lot, so don't worry about it too much. legends 1 can absolutely be recommended in good conscious. just give whoever your recommending it to a heads up about the lack of analog control and they should be fine. also, this is a problem exclusive to legends 1 since legends 2 does have traditional analog control as well as a traditional lock-on.

- i agree with maverick. figure out what kind of sorceress your friend is going to be playing, and try to use a different damage type. also, a sorceress is pretty squishy, so something that can absorb some damage would be useful. if you are the type of player that likes to whack at enemies one by one, a zeal paladin or barbarian can be fun. if you prefer casters, wind druids can be strong with basic equipment and have pretty beefy summons.

Here's my attempt:

I'm constantly torn between feeling like I'm drowning in a sea of possibilities, only to be met with the deafening silence of uncertainty.

- att now reports phones lost or stolen. when finance on one account and used on another. and yes you are correct they would let you do this before as i ve always done it also. but now they are cracking down on it. i m guessing to prevent customers opening accounts, selling the phones and letting the account go delinquent.

- thanks again. i watched the israel segments of the show first half . and, i have to agree with you. this was a very poor showing from douglas. he was flippant about the west bank settlements and the suffering of those palestinians. and he was curiously dismissive of the concerns that israeli protesters are raising against bibi for his failures. douglas reverted back twice to the fact that israel is a democracy and thus its leaders are subject to public pressure as some kind of unfair disadvantage in conducting the war given that hamas no longer permits elections. that s a bit rich given that the strength of western support hinges on the fact that israel remains a democracy. thanks again for alerting me to the interview. i hope sam will watch it too.

- also something i missed, but with the whole weasel woo debacle, i don't know how much respect woo has over kass. kass at least made an actual game move, while woo was kind of breaking the rules.

- my son, who now has a ph.d in music composition, went through the tj advanced musical program, which is i think what this was 20 years ago. it is what absolutely enabled him to get him free rides through his doctorate. if this is anything like that, go for it. he now heads up a large youth musical organization, performs live regularly, and has had his compositions performed gobally.

- thats capitalism baby. its here to stay, its a free market, owners want the their franchises to be as highly valuable as possible and giving new owners the option to move the team if they want increases that value.

- yep, in fact i didn t mentioned that guards compared to her, but she s still better than sanya who has to use a skill to turn into a part time guard. she remains a good tank because of her versatily, because obviously you cannot put eanya next to fire units or bride astrid next to poison sleep units, so she s still pretty useful and i thought the a was too much cruel for her.

- yeah bowden would be better, and i also suffer with my specific direct drive and its suboptimal filament path. so far though the silicone tube trick is working very well! and the sidewinder x1 doesn t seem to mind the tolerance it produces; and it s finicky.

- oh no no its not my native language. i'm indian as much as you are, the language that i learnt or still learning out of interest or for better job opportunities is english. arabic, i'm learning to impress the girl yeah, she's and arab i love.

- i also sold my bag of algo but for slightly different reasons. i only had a very small bag to begin with anyway and i was considering it as part of my downsized portfolio but it didn't make the cut at the end of the day. i have nothing against it and i think it's a great project but i suppose what tipped the balance at the end of the day was that i'd missed the sign up for the next governance period. i was really interested in it and wanted to take part but equally i wanted to rebalance my portfolio to include more coins that i could stake with and wasn't willing to wait around for algo. i'd like to pick it up again down theine if the price doesn't take off before i get there but right now i have other priorities.

I'm constantly on edge, yet I don't mind being pushed off the ledge. It's like my existence revolves around this emotional limbo, where the tiniest detail can send me plummeting into an abyss of self-doubt.

- mine have been so wonky last couple weeks so i am guessing this is the issue. just switched from textra to google messages to see if that fixed it and getting messages that are meant for a group chat creating a new group chat with one person missing. the two family group chats i use have grown to 5 group chats. 2 people have iphone, everyone else, 5 people, have android, although not sure what app they all use for messaging.

- work more fiber into your diet. chia seeds, oatmeal and tons of popcorn does it for me so when you go, it all goes ; coffee helps you go to the bathroom, but the lack of fiber is most likely why your stools aren t solid. cut back on oils to and drink tons of water .this is coming from someone with a classic case of jewish inherited ibs - have been to several doctors including gastroenterologists and refuse to take a medicine to cure what should be happening in all of our bodies naturally short of those with ibd s it s 100 diet related you don t need to introduce additional chemicals into your body, yes they work, but i prefer solving the issue rather than just throwing something at it to temporarily suppress it.

- i say 100m if you have over 1b in purse. there would be data on how much you lose with how much in the purse. would be better in the game because it wouldn't hurt people as much.

- if having consistent subscription revenue lets them lower the iap prices and gives them more resources to fix bugs, then i'm all for it. reliable revenue could mean they could focus on longer-term things rather than expensive, one-time cosmetic purchases. heck, even access to free random instrument spells would be kind of cool since only 1 3 of all instruments are permanently available.

- i never thought about a pay difference between wrenching on bikes vs wrenching on cars. however i know going to work without thinking i should have done every damn day is priceless that said, at your age all i wanted to do was wrench on cars. found out i loved wrenching on my cars and hated wrenching on cars in a shop setting.

- unfortunately, git gud is the only thing you can say to those players . hate to say it, but it really is the only thing you can say. there are just things they don't get, nor will they realize until they git gud.

- that happened to me when i switched from a switch lite to switch regular. i didn t know how to transfer my save files so i lost everything.

- prior to declaring war to my first neighbor, it seemed that one of their colonized systems defected leading to a new empire popping in and going to war with the main empire. after completing the domination tree, i had made sure to build up my two fleets to their maximum size, at the time, of 40 ships before going to war. i had also made it to where the only claimed systems were ones that were colonized. upon going to war i made short work of both empires. it was practically a cakewalk given that my two fleets each were at 3k fleet power, more than enough to completely demolish any opposition. upon conquering the two empires, i decided to use their pops to generate large sums of food for a short period of time. i had to make sure that none of my pops were growing at any of the planets while the natives were being processed. so far, i'm very pleased with how this empire turned out, especially given how quickly i've gotten my production at in such a short amount of time. not only that, but i'm also thankful that it hasn't been broken too much after the patch came in.

- okay so if they made a mistake why not just refund and not waste any more of my time? i'm a seller too and that how i'd handle that situation. i've sold over 100,000 items on ebay. when i fuck up i don't make the buyer do anything to correct my mistake.

- also something i missed, but with the whole weasel woo debacle, i don't know how much respect woo has over kass. kass at least made an actual game move, while woo was kind of breaking the rules.

- i did. i tried to call tsa but it s all automated, and i came here to see if other people have flown without an id.

- ros is way more useful thanks to his ability to nulifiy endurance and gv are way far more useful than ui omen overally. you could still use ui omen to play passively and deal damage agaisnt fusion warrior units, but, simply, there are better options than him.

- that is also a good combo, the thing with thorn is i think it can stun on one hit requires proper testing i haven't tried lol so that is why i use it but yeah most things work anyway so it's really a matter of preference.

- thank you for sharing! i like the sound of those coriander carrots! and i haven t tried heard about the carrot cake jam, i ll have to keep that in mind to try.

- but why? kion x fuli are perfect for each other, lol only 2 types of people exist, kion x fuli shippers, and kion x rani shipper, and i will never join kion x rani shippers because every last of them are traitors and i will never join them meaning i will never ship kion x rani .

 [/INST]","Here is my Reddit comment as a normal Reddit user diagnosed with MDD:

I've been noticing lately that I've started to prioritize things in my life, which might seem like the opposite of what's actually going on. While it feels like I'm constantly stuck in this cycle of apathy and disinterest, there are still moments where I'll catch myself intensely focusing on a particular task. It's almost as if I'm suddenly jolted out of my own indifference and become consumed by something specific. At times, I feel like I'm going through the motions, but then an old passion resurfaces and I'm completely absorbed in it. It's this weird sense of detachment vs. immersion that's been plaguing me lately.",200,0.8,0.95,40,1.1,0,0,['</s>'],Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct.IQ1_S.gguf

- anything i break is going to be upgraded to xt for sure. right now i'm already planning on upgrading to the xt rotors as the slxs seem to have trouble staying true after heat cycling too much.

- the logo deffo needs some work done to it, it s not our current logo she just did a quick mock-up for it.

- honestly, warlords of draenor had the most satisfying leveling experience of each expansion when it was current. each zone gave you a choice of new actions to use once you'd unlocked that zone's outpost, the world treasures were all unique moments of environmental storytelling and the toys you got as a result were fantastic loot-a-rang smoothed looting from a distance even for non-engineers, the launching totem and slow-fall toys gave a new transportation option in the days before flight would be accessible, the garrison hearthstone let you mix up your personal hearthing strategy while still having a quick return to your base of operations, but most importantly wod is the expansion that introduced the flight master's whistle. with the click of a button, you were whisked away to the nearest flight master. when leveling without flying, it was magnificent. now if it seems like i'm focusing on the movement options over everything else, you might conclude that an expansion like dragonflight should be my favorite, since it gives flying just a few quests into the first zone. and that's reasonable! dragonflight might very well unseat wod for me, some day. but wod had such a perfect mix of obstacles and tools to mitigate those obstacles that i had more fun questing there than anywhere else. if you already have flying, though, all that goes out the window. then it's something like dragonflight wod mop bfa legion shadowlands cataclysm wotlk tbc.

- i love it. it was my modern deck and its always fun to play. especially when opponents rage on the hexproof ability and daybreak coronet.

- i ll check in with you on november 6th and see how you are doing.

- i'm not really a windows user now switched to linux for various reasons i dual boot it still for some programs like the adobe suite but rarely use it but i used to use it as my main for years and the reason i didn't buy mac was because it was out of my price range and 2 or 3 apps i used didn't work there although there were very good alternative apps there i am too lazy and ofc new mac hardware is top notch so if i had the money i'd probably buy one. but as to why they chose windows these are most probably the reasons half the people would give.

- i'm playing a life oracle in pf2e and it's a blast. do i heal every turn? no but i also help a lot with damage mitigation and heal a bunch. most of my spell slots go towards healing and i love it.

- - getting to him after the inauguration specifically so i can kill him.- hi, i'm finishing up act 3 and have most of the side qs done but need to kill the 2 chosen. orin told me to go kill gortash or she will kill the little girl so that's what i'm trying to do. is the only way to get to him to fight through the fist guards in the wyrm keep? do i need to do the dragon q for wyll first? i'd prefer to avoid killing the guards since they don't really deserve it is all. thanks.

- well i wish you luck. hopefully you get everything ima just have to wait for the tour.

- you got lucky is all i m saying. could ve gone a completely different way. they only took weed is wild considering it s someone who broke in with a gun, which means they had intention of violence by your definition and they also took your sense of security. i guess maybe next time you can throw a pillow at them or give them a smooch. how would a gun have saved you from a break in? one of my buddies had 3 armed men in his backyard attempting to open his sliding door to his backyard. he drew his weapon and shined a laser on them and they all fled. that s how. who knows what they would ve done to him. again, you got lucky.

 [/INST]","Here is a comment from a person who has been diagnosed with MDD:

I've lately found myself in an unsettling state of mind. I'm plagued by this perpetual feeling of hopelessness, and no matter how hard I try to shake it off, the sense of emptiness clings to me like a bad cold. It's not that I'm unable to appreciate life's little joys; rather, my perspective has become so distorted that even the most mundane tasks feel like climbing an insurmountable mountain.",200,0.8,0.95,40,1.1,0,0,['</s>'],Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct.IQ1_S.gguf

Here are some example comments:
- hi, i am trying to share my screen in firefox while i'm in wayland but all it shows is a black screen no matter if i try to share a window or my entire screen. i have tried to follow many guides on google but non of them worked. i am using fedora with kde. if you need any more system information please ask me and i will reply with the necessary information as soon as i can. thank you in advance.

- thanks, i really am! usually pretty lackluster on the stuff i do but this one is top notch for me. and to think i m supposed to sell it.

- yes, there are only 4 black f50 s in the world, per multiple sources online. however, u eintier pointed out that this one is likely wrapped so it is probably a boring old red f50.

- explain this, lol if you'd show the whole interview, you'll also see that he told that they think that the hamas shot the rocket absolute clown .

- same. kind of want to meet one just to see it but also terrified of meeting one lol.

- parts of it look like this on the series x. this game is great and all, but sometimes i feel like i'm playing a nintendo 64 game.

- you people come and say that, but the post is absolutely correct.

- like i said, i never really cared or wanted the cameos, but they definitely added something not as much as watching frank eat cinnamon buns or pretend to play football with gene but it added something i think. i also think the scam con in episode 11 was pretty awesome too. but definitely not as awesome as hoping a security guard just eats his cinnamon bun and doesn't even bother to glance over his shoulder. that's true genius! nippy was good, but it's exactly what everyone who didn't praise it as an all timer expected it to be. and i'm being cheeky, but seriously episode 11 had a more interesting dynamic of the gene saul jimmy character in my opinion. felt like you kind of saw it all battling back and forth with each other.

- rather then pay simmons 8 million to stay, i guess we've got to waste money on saints backups.

- only time i've ever read down in alaska i pay 105 for 4mb down in alaska's biggest city. when i upgraded from 1mb down it was a big day.

Provide something more diverse than the previous posts.
Change the structure at the beginning of your response: it shouldn't follow the format of your previous posts.
